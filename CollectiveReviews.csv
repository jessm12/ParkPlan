"Disneyland that lost it's magic, totally","We have visited multiple Disney parks in our life and we decided to give Disneyland Paris a go despite the numerous not so good reviews and we decided to splurge on staying at the Disneyland Hotel itself. The location and decor was the only great thing in the hotel, but the price of the hotel is much doubtful when we are downright discriminated by some of the staff which pulls down the overall experience. We have never felt disappointed and unhappy and eagerly excited to leave Disneyland as a whole in our whole life being really avid fans of Disney and traveling around for all the different parks. Majority of the staff were polite but they did not carry the theme and hype of Disney.
After traveling to many parks, Disneyland Paris took away the magic and totally diminished any magic left in us.
Particularly several staff that you may have to interact with a lot such as the hotel receptionists handling the checking in and out. None of the staff were helpful with baggage, none of the staff were initiative. Particularly, Arianna, please beware that you have to be in her books or you shall be downright discriminated and treated as a fool for being a hotel guest in their most expensive hotel."
Smokers everywhere. Minimal non-sugar food offerings. Toddler would still enjoy.,"If you've never been to ANY Disney park, the kids will still enjoy ok.
Smoking is permitted almost everywhere outdoors, and was overwhelming.
A piece of chicken + fries was 17€.Can´t buy fries alone. I'd actually recommend getting kids' menu (chickenburger/fries/drink/ice cream) for everyone (8.99€).
Access from centre of Paris easy - use the stop in Auber, as this ensures you have a seat.
Simply doesn't compare with any park in the USA or Asia."
We had a great time but....,"We had a great time but....
This places is an overcrowded, outdated rip-off simply cashing in on being Disney.
This is our second visit, both being at Christmas. This time we stayed at the Disneyland hotel (I’ll review separately) but needless to say that ain’t great either.
Last time we stayed at sequoia lodge but when we priced up staying there again, character lunches and wild bills it was pretty much the same price as staying at the Disneyland hotel where it was all packaged together.
The magic hours are a god send. We really made the most of these and used them to get on everything we wanted numerous times (we had 3 days of these). The average queues outside of the magic hours for any of these rides was at least an hour. (Peter pan, hyperspace mountain, buzz light year, mine train etc). Being prepared for this we instead booked in all the character meals, took in the parades and shows, generally made the most of the Disney experience.
It’s not all bad. The parades and shows are really really good. As are the character lunches and the general being Disney stuff.
The problem with this place is it’s pretty small. There’s probably as many attractions in Alton towers. The place needs updating, Disney Florida are constantly expanding and updating but when did Paris last get a new ride/park that wasn’t a rehash of a previous one. It simply isn’t big enough in terms of attractions to take the number of visitors.
It’s also a massive rip off, food and drink prices are beyond a joke. You even need a small mortgage for a coke or a bag of crisps.
Then there’s the smoking and queue jumping. Smoking is everywhere, even in the queues. Staff do not challenge it even when it’s right in front of them. I even smelt cannabis at one point.
I knew before I went this was the last time we would go. We went for the Disney Christmas experience. We loved it and the kids loved it.
Is it value for money: absolutely not. Do they care: clearly not!"
Beautiful but..,"I had been to Disneyland Paris in October 2018, and wanted to compare my visit to December 2019. One thing that stuck out to me was half the restaurants and carts were closed on both visits! I’ve never seen Disney not have everything open to suck every last penny from our wallets, but Disneyland Paris apparently does not care. The decorations were beautiful and the rides are awesome like always. It’s a must stop for any Disney lover."
Great fun but overpriced,"Disneyland is great fun for all ages it really is. We were very disappointed to discover that if you have the half board dining plan, you had to book to eat at a buffet restaurant. We were not informed of this beforehand and it spoilt our day somewhat to be told by a rude french lady that we could not have a table as we hadn't booked. We then had to queue for 40 minutes for a counter service burger. The only way you can book restaurants before you go is to call the restaurant- this is no good if you are in the UK as of course you would be calling a french number.
Best to get fastpass on some of the rides (Thunder Mountain & Buzz Lightyear) but we didn't queue for any ride longer then 25 minutes.
The parades are lovely to watch and the fireworks are really good. Good idea to stay in a Disney Hotel close to the park because the shuttle buses get very busy when the fireworks are over."
Dated and run down with rude staff,"The staff at Disneyland Paris are rude and not helpful. Not a smile on anyone’s face. It is definitely a bucket list with no return.
1. Most of the rides are shorter than California. For example, the RC Races does two swings only. It’s a Small World runs only a for six minutes while California runs for over 10 minutes.
2. Buzz light year guns don’t work. They go off and on.
3. Staff are always chatting to each other and they don’t smile to the general public. This is literally throughout Disneyland Paris.
4. While I was trying to purchase an expensive glass rose from one of their shops, two staff members kept talking to each other. One of them was actually trying to complete my transaction. They seemed to be annoyed that I had a few questions to ask.
5. Audrey from Hypersapce was standing at the front entrance. She seemed to be upset about something. I asked her if the single rider is open. She scolded me and questioned why I ask. Not a smile on her face. Very rude. However, I dare you to find more than five staff members through the park who know how to smile or are genuinely wanting to help.
6. Disney charters are hidden behind closed doors with none to see. Waiting time 90 minutes plus at least.
7. The food is not too bad.
Would I have cancelled this trip if I go back in time, maybe not because I needed to experience it myself with my family.
Am I going to come back, definitely not. Especially with the rude staff, short and dated rides.
Did I enjoy the rides. Yes I did but nowhere to compare to Disneyland California."
Magical at all ages,"Second time around and I really loved it. My daughter and I had a great time. She did rides she wasn’t confident to do last time. It was her highlight of our Paris trip.
I really enjoyed how you make us feel when we are there. La magie continue"
Save your hard earned money and go to alton towers,"Just to add to the many bad reviews (these are true!) the 5-4 star one's must be by Disney staff or the brainwashed!!
Discusting corporate greed of the highest order, you expect to pay more but come on 10 euro for a balloon!!? After spending 4 days here I was actually looking forward to getting to the airport and paying their prices!!
Staff hit and miss generally unfriendly and quite unhelpful but again we expected this, been English they can't abide us and it shows in the attitude of some of them.
Go somewhere else don't give this company one penny of your hard earned cash!!"
Money for old rope,"Disneyland was supposed to be the highlight of our European Trip for our 3 children. Instead it was overpriced, overcrowded and the rides were starting to feel old and dated. 14/12 was a supermaxi price day which means it's the highest price bracket. The park was packed, queues were long, it was difficult to find anything/anywhere to eat, the merchandise was excessively over priced. The whole experience felt like a Disney cash grab!"
Guards behaviour,"This is absolutely magic and beautiful place without any doubts!
There are big lines to some attractions but this is something you are aware of before you go. If I may recommend anything is that if you have 2days and budget for it stay there for two days and just enjoy the moment and don’t rush.
Now...
I’m not the one who is complaining without a real reason.
Unfortunately there was a huge disappointment and I think Disneyland manager should better take care of the crew they are hiring for security that is very important but the person that are working at the gates and their behaviour is totally unacceptable. They are so rude! I had to stay 15min only in my T-shirt in -2celcious as one of the guard was checking every single button in my jacket. The whole procedure to get there for our family took very long so you can imagine staying at the gates with kids because someone is shouting at you in French and telling you to undress.
Same rude people are working at the lockers on the main station. There were shouting at us in french and didn’t took in the end our bags in the end so we had to walk with everything."
Wonderfull,First time in Paris with my children. We went to Disneyland Paris to discover this park. My children were amazed.The Christmas decorations were beautiful and the performances were fabulous. Magical moment!! We leave with lots of photos.
Relaxing Holiday,Disneyland is always wonderful. It was a cold winter day with rain but the youthful spirit of Mickey Mouse prevails. The parade was still awesome.
Its absolutely Magical,"Went here in April with our 2 kids aged 7 and 14 and we at first didnt like it as queues are so long but there is so much to do and some Rides are shorter to go on. We done so much in the few days we visited and i'd highly recommend it to people with or without the Kids.
Planning to Return in 2020 or shortly after as we've other trips planned ahead of this."
An Improving Park,"The park has really improved over the last five years. I have been once a year since 2015 and there are more characters and entertainment than ever before. However I do still find there should be more random characters as every day there are the exact same characters bar one or 2 surprise ones. Fir the number of guests every day there really should be a character everywhere you look.
Apart from this I do love this park and the rides especially those renovated over the past couple of years are just incredible. There are so many little details everywhere you look.
The parades and fireworks are just spectacular and I cry every time without fail!"
Family visit over Christmas,"We visited Disneyland Paris wirh our toddler over Christmas 2018 and we all loved it.
It was very busy (as expected) but the atmosphere was great. The Christmas decorations were beautiful and the performances were fabulous.
The fireworks were spectacular.
We only visited for 3 days, and didn't manage to see everything. I suppose if you went during quieter times it would've been possible.
The rides for younger children are great and they have loads of them.
Food is quite expensive for what it is (mainly fast food). They do have other places to eat but it was out of our budget.
We are planning a visit again soon and we can't wait to get there :)"
"Enjoyed Our Time, But Remember It’s Not Orlando!","Came here in November and the first thing that struck me was how busy it was, considering it was school term time. We enjoyed it and managed to get everything done in a day. We loved Space Mountain. Having done Florida a few times I would definitely say this is on a smaller scale, price for price I think I would rather go to the states. The firework show was really good with various songs/movies being projected onto the castle. Prices for food and drink inside the park are of course are expensive but there is no restriction on bringing your own, also small back packs were allowed on the rides including Space Mountain. Tip buy your tickets online and not at the gate you will save a fortune!!! One park One day admission was €107!!!"
"Recommend multiple days, busy even in off-season","We were not expecting the crowds at Disneyland Paris in October that we found. The lines do not move fast and many rides do not accommodate many riders, so plan accordingly. Our plan was to do both parks in one day, not a reality and we missed many attractions due to this one day plan. They also repair many rides during the off season. This all said, we loved the park. The atmosphere is different from the American theme parks, the buildings are french and a multi-cultural experience. The cast members are helpful. Skip Chef Remy - big disappointment in food quality and service - plus the time and slow service. Better to grab the same or better food from quick service. Make sure you explore the castle, this is one Disney park that has attractions and adventures in the castle. Enjoy - this place will put a smile on your face."
One of the happiest places to visit - Disney Land,"Disneyland is truly the happiest place on earth for me. I can’t imagine not going to Disney just because I’m not a child anymore or dont have kids to take. Even better for me without kids.
I have always been a Disney person, from watching the animated films, reading books, it's just a form of escapism for me. I have visited Disney World Orlando several times, with my son and on my own. I have made so many amazing memories at the parks and it brings me back to my childhood. I can never tire of it and guess I would be pushing a Zimmer frame in old age going around the parks. Disneyland Paris though not as big as the ones in America is still very good and as exciting. Good for all the family. One of my happy places on earth."
Charming Visit at Christmas,"The decorations, parades,flowers and lights were perfectly made for Christmas season.
We took the RER from CDG-Etoille to DLP.
We had our tickets printed at home and had no problems scanning it at the gates or at the fast pass machines.
We arrived by 9:30, they let us in a little earlier. We started with Hollywood studio park. Crush's coaster, fast-pass for Ratatouille , where we met the characters and had fun . Then we left to go to Park 2 . We played Hyper-Space mountain, Star Tours and Buzz light year. Then we headed to Frontier-land to play the Big Thunder Mountain and to get on the big sailing ship. Afterwards, we played the Pirates of the Caribbean and finally at Fantasyland we played it's a small world.
The Christmas Parade was unmissable ! The songs, colors and everything was perfect. Afterwards we loved the All Characters parade followed by the greatest lighting of the Christmas tree and finally the big famous Disney Illumination Show.
The weather was a bit cold , the rain was very very light that you can't feel it and it didn't last long as well.
The Wifi connection was good. The application was very helpful.
I had visited Disneyland before in May 2018. It was not as perfect as it was in Christmas season."
Magical place at Christmas.,We have been here on many occasions before but this was the first time at Christmas Time. Main Street was beautifully decorated with massive Christmas tree and decorations and a snow machine which blew out snow from above at various times to make a fab effect. As ever the park has great rides for all ages and during the day there is two Christmas themed parades. A truly Great place to visit at Christmas.
5 Stars only for Cedric,"Went to Disneyland last week for my 18th...thoroughly enjoyed all the rides. However, my experience was completed by two of the actors on the Hollywood Tower of Terror. I’d like to give a shout out to Cedric and Marine for their acting that exceeded exceptions and left me wanting more. I think both deserve a pay rise...my experience would not have been the same without them!"
Terrible,"If you want a Disney experience do not go to Disneyland paris, save up and go to Florida. Both parks are dated, they feel old and look old. The cast members are rude, lazy and pretend they dont speak English. The Disney village is tired and boring not worth the time. This Christmas stuff was ok but not mind blowing."
Was a real letdown,"Went to Disneyland this week and felt really disappointed there was not rides for teenagers rock n roller had been taken down, space mountain was shut, have a 15,13,8 all mixed age groups I found there was nothing for teens.
I visited Disneyland a few years ago were the characters walked around the park this was so much more fun then booking appointments to see them.
I found the whole park had not changed since we first went at that was 2006 Definitely needs more and new rides and go back to letting the characters walk around the park again it was so much more magical."
"It’s Disneyland, what’s not to love?","I’ve been here many times over the years growing up and brought my girlfriend as a surprise this year for her first time and my first time in 10+ years.
We both loved it, there’s entertainment across the two parks for everyone if all ages. It’s just such a great time and there’s no experience like walking through the main gates and hearing the music and being immersed in the Disney magic!
It is expensive, all the merch and food is expensive, but which theme park isn’t?
It also gets busy, so have an idea of what you want to do the day you’re there and use the apps wisely!"
Fun Day,"The best family park in Europe where tou can spend your fun time with all members of families and friends.
Amazing attraction, games and shows"
Magical but expensive,"First this is Disneyland - so who couldn't enjoy the atmosphere and even more so heading towards Christmas time. The Christmas parade was beautiful and the lighting of of the Christmas tree spectacular. We spent 2 days in fantasy land.
We stayed at the explorers hotel - rooms were basic but comfortable. Lots for kids to do when you're not in the parks. The free shuttle service was excellent - find out where you're to pick the shuttle up - the pick up and drop off were in one place but we had to go to a different 'bus stop' from where we were dropped off. Worth checking so you're not rushing at the end of the day- with tired feet and tired kids!
But the queues!
Not many street vendors so you are pushed to go into restaurants- the queues are ridiculous- waiting an hour for lunch!
We waited an hour to see 1 princess and that was a good waiting time - when came out it was up to 2 hours. But for us an hour that was worth it.
Money money money but be funny...
For anyone who has been to Paris before - it's expensive but Disneyland takes that to another level. €80 for a kids Elsa dress up outfit (£33 back in Disney store in the UK!) - and yes we did get stung - we promised our little one she could buy an outfit - we couldn't go back on it! All the costumes were similar price!
On the second day - now feeling skint! We found a McDonald's for lunch - you have to come out the park (but easy to get back in) it's behind planet Hollywood - near rainforest cafe - similar price to back home. Ok so not the fine dining experience that you may expect in paris but quicker and cheaper than the ones inside the park.
And ask - if you've not been before speak to other families in the hotel or on the shuttle - best way to get top tips. After all you don't want your stresses to ruin the day.
Did we have a good time- of course we did and would defo come back but just be prepared to spend more than you planned."
Amazinggg!!!,"I love Disneyland Paris. It was my third time visiting but my first time visiting when there were the Christmas decorations and it was magical. A bit annoying is all the queues to certain rides and some people putting their phones up when there is a parade. However, that has nothing to do with the park as such. It's amazing and I dare say that it is a must visit at least once in your life."
Just as good as Florida,"A lot of people said to me that this place wouldn't be as good because I had been to America and to be honest, I was pleasantly surprised with how good it was. Of course it isn't as big as Florida and maybe there arent as many rides for the big kids but children would definitely enjoy it just as much and my partner and I enjoyed it, the big kids that we are.
I would recommend coming off season and during the weekday as we managed to get around everything in one day.
Coming without a bag makes life much easier.
Also, we have a system, you start at the back of the park, then work your way forward, we found that everyone runs onto the rides right at the front making the lines huge but the ones at the back we literally walked through to the end. Do that!
Seeing Disney characters you have to book in advance. Luckily we got a space to see Jack which was a nice surprise from the boyfriend.
Overall, I had a really good time here. I would tell people to not think down on it because it's not an american Disney. Just as good"
Definitely go for Christmas,"The theming at this time of year is amazing - from the beautiful decorations to the fabulous themed snacks. Its just a magical time to visit and really gets you in the festive spirit. The Christmas parade and tree lighting ceremony are amazing - and the snow down main street is fab.
I wish there was a few more Christmas themed meet and greets but jack skellington and santa stitch were super cute!"
Magical,"We have just returned, we had the most amazing time and have made memories that will last forever! All of the rides, parades and shows are perfect. All the staff were so friendly and helpful!"
"Lower your expectations if you've been to Disneyland, Disney Cruise, Disneyworld, Aulani","The grounds were well decorated for Christmas. The parade was pretty festive. However, for us and our spoiled kids, Disneyland Paris just did not compare to Disney in the U.S. The clerks at the stores and restaurants were definitely missing the Disney Magic. Some of the stores cashiers, not all, just seemed indiferent and lacked the same friendliness we are used to. We are still glad we went as our girls are still at that perfect age (5 and 7) but I'm not sure I'd bother if you've been to the other Disneys and your children are older."
Think twice these points before you go,"I do not recommend anybody due to following rational reasons: (our kids were 4 years old daughter and 8 years old boy during the visit)
1- Very expensive. We paid 410 USd for family of four with the highest price class. The other two cheap classes are not realistic to benefit from because it is only school days in when the kids can not technically come. Most of the alternatives in Europe is just half price at most
2- Beside the Frozen and Mickey Mouse none of characters are known by the kids of today’s. So it is old fashioned. 10 years ago it could be interesting but now there are plenty of better options in many countries.
3-The car park was 30 eur and 1.2 km away from the main entry which makes you walk 15 minutes * 2 = Half an hour just for reaching the gates. Add the possible que in the cashiers too In Germany for instance most of them are free of charge or max just 7 Eur.
4- It is too big! Not optional for kids who are easily bored with walking one point to another.
5- we preferred a rainy November day just to avoid the queues but apparently we were not the only stupids: Almost every attraction was requiring minimum 60 minutes in the queue although it was not the most popular time like summer! Imagine you are with 2 kids who is bored, hungry and multiply with other parents! I have never seen a single happy kid inside!!! We just spent 1 hour to shake Mickey’s hand
6-There are too less seats in the restaurants inside so everyone is running first inside to make an appointment with lunch time. I understood why when I saw the long lines in just to grab a seat when it is noon time. Very frustrating to be have to wait in another line when you are hungry and tired
7- The staff inside is generally insisting on speaking in French and it is really annoying. I get used to this weird attitude and insistence of people in France but not also in a US company which charged me USD instead of EUR!?! It is an international place, come on...
7- Except the night parade and some shops inside, there is nothing amazing. All toys are not better than regular amusement park.
8- It is one hour drive from Paris (still they charge car park as Champs Elyse price!!!)
9-Most of the guests are coming just due to prestigious (!) “once in a lifetime” sickness. Everybody seems more interested with Selfies! If you are one of those blind guys attracted by an American PR, then just go for it...
My kids are quite patent, we could even spent 4 hours in Louvre Museum with them a day ago but for the first time they wanted to leave an amusement park in the middle of a day!?! They are quite health kids, believe me It is not they but Disneyland.
So... Long story short: Most of your friends are not telling the truth whatever the reason is but I am now: The king is complete naked!!!
It is a clear money trap. The only kid to be happy for visit is Disney Junior!If you have plenty of , just spread over there (with a hotel package and couple of days which is pretty much a small fortune!)"
What a blast,"We spent 5 days at this park while staying at the Newport Bay Club Hotel. The days were really busy, especially with the late Illuminations show during summer. The park was not too busy, but of course, there were queues at the more popular rides.
Our entire family (with children aged 5 to 10) really enjoyed everything, and we arrived every day as the park opened for Extra Magic time, and left after Illuminations, with few breaks. We especially loved the roller coasters, with Big Thunder Mountajn Railroad perhaps being the family favorite.
We would love to go back, but distance and cost might force us to stay local for a while!"
Magical,"The best place in the world, where everyone can be himself and not be judged by how silly you’re being. My 2 year old loved the parade and kept waving at everyone, and most of the characters came up to her. Simply magical. Some rides are good for her age too :)"
One day visit for family,"We visited Disneyland 20th Nov 2019.
On arrival we exited our bus and followed the crowds to what we thought was the Disneyland gates but was actually Disney Studios, luckily we realised this just inside and where able to change our tickets at the ticketing booth for new ones and headed to the correct entrance. When we were getting new tickets a number of people had done the same thing. So don’t make this mistake.
Once in Disney it is a magical place, as it was mid week and heading into winter numbers were down, but this meant a few restaurants not open so those that were open were very busy. The park itself is very clean and very well presented.
Young kids enjoyed the small world ride, then a great ride for everyone was the Pirates of the Caribbean.
Make sure you catch one of the parades with the Disney characters.
On this Pirates ride we could see a really cool restaurant along the ride, but later found out you needed to book ahead. So book ahead for a great food option.
It was cold in Nov so rug up as hard to get out of the breeze.
Kids had a great day, we spent 6 hours in the park and left as the sun was dropping and so was the temperature.
Food & merchandise is expensive, but that’s to be expected.
We could not find anywhere comfortable to eat so ate outside the gates at Planet Hollywood once we exited. A great feed.
This was our last day of three weeks in France, we were use to the polite courteous French during this time, getting to Disney woke us up again to the hurry many other countries feel the need to do.
Remember to relax and enjoy your day."
Christmas,"Had a lovely time. Park is lovely and clean. I was wary about the staff on reading other reviews but I found them all to be nice. The staff on the tower of terror ride were hilarious especially the man who shakes the chains while people are lining up. It is a lot smaller than what I imagined it to be, but it suited my children as there was less walking to do. There is a lot of shops it’s hard not to want to buy everything but you need a lot of money as everything seems almost double the price for the same things from Disneystore in the uk. They need more places to eat and more options of food. There is only so much chips/ hotdogs and fizzy drinks we could tolerate. Parades and fireworks are fantastic. My tip is to go to crushes coaster first and the queue for this ride gets very long very fast, they don’t have a fast pass option for this ride. Thanks for a great holiday Disneyland"
Loved it!,"Had such a great time. So magical with all Xmas decorations now up.
Lots of helpful staff, queue times good, parks clean and well kept.
Cons: had our pram taken. Food TERRIBLE not enough areas to sit and have a hot choc or cuppa to rest and recuperate before next thrill.
Special mention to Jamel in City Hall who went over and above to help us once our buggy went missing."
Our annual visit,Spent the week for the beginning of the Christmas festivities. Was busy but not to bad. The weather was not kind to us. But we managed to see a lot of characters. Not all the characters have photographers but the cast members are happy to take photos for you. You can purchase a Disney photo pass for €75 and the photographer will scan you card and they will appear on your app for you to print at home. Used the fast pass to get in the rides. Make sure you try a Mickey shaped cookie.
"Lovely on the whole, definitely different from US parks!","We chose to visit on a weekday, with the help of the Disney website's crowd level forcaster which certainly helped, but the poor weather shortened our stay (worst hail storm these Californians had ever seen was on it's way in, we wanted to be on the train back to our hotel before it it!). The parts we experienced were great, and the things we disliked (attitudes of some parents/children) were the same that we run into in the US parks, so that was no surprise. We found that all employees we ran into spoke English which was very nice, and we loved the shopping options. If you are a fan of the Hyperspace Mountain ride (especially the Anaheim version, which we thought prior to this was the best one), please please please do yourself a favor and leave time for one, or maybe three trips on the Paris version of Hyperspace Mountain. It was sooooo much better than the other versions we have ridden in Anaheim and Orlando! Really enjoyed the Phantom Manor (aka Haunted Mansion) and the Pirates of the Caribbean.
Be forewarned if you plan to take the RER A train station to the park on a weekday, during typical commute hours the train is INSANELY busy. I have never been in a train that crowded. This was one other reason we were glad to shorten our stay at the park to leave prior to commute hours on the return trip, in addition to the weather."
Nice experience,"If you expect a lot of roler-coasters, you’ll be disappointed. This park is not for a fun like that, but anyway, it is worth visiting. Everything is so nice and you really become a part of Disney world for a moment. They pay attention to details, so it’s like you are in real fairytale. Must see is a fireworks at the closing, don’t miss that."
Small but not bad,"The park is doable in less than a day and the attractions are similar to the ones in Orlando. It was crowded even when it was low season and Parisian rain almost never stopped.
The prices are excessive, the personnel of the park not nice (even when most of them are not french... and even when I do speak it!)
They shall offer Fast Pass system as is in Orlando"
The most magical place in the world,"What can I say, it’s Disney! Had the most magical time with my family. Met loads of the characters we have watched through the years. The fireworks and parade are a must see! Will look to come back in 2020. Only recommendation for this time, is to save plenty of saving money, as I will want to purchase the whole shop!"
Amazing but....,"Amazing experience but too small for me since I have been to the one in the USA. But all and all clean and very nice. Should go with kids and stay till the parade which is amazing also. Food and drinks are kinda of expensive but not the great in quality. Should go early and get passes for the big attractions. Don’t miss the buzz light year, Star Wars, thunder mountain, and the pirates. Have a great time."
Not sure,I have been to Disneyland in LA and Orlando. I visited this one and my opinion this one is so so . I didn't fell the same magic of Disneyland and the place and the rides were not the same. Maybe it was just me but I was bit disappointed from this Disneyland Park in Europe.
Good,"Pretty good Disney experience, but not as magical as Disneyworld in Florida. This park and the Studios next door take 2 days, max."
Amazing,"Great place to go, no matter what age. Smaller than florida and california but still really great. This park has great rides for big and small people. Staff are nice. But the only problem was queuing. Very busy but they can't help that. Xx decently recommend it"
Family of 3 visit,"Absolutely magical with the xmas theme in the park, parades and illuminations amazing. We had the dream pass /fast pass which is a must if staying in the park. Food isnt great in the parks and quite expensive. Large mcdonalds in the Disney Village was ok. Stay away from Annette's Diner extremely poor couldn't care less service. The fast pass is a must!"
Felt ripped iff,"Came to Disneyland Paris for a few nights. Very disappointed to see so many rides closed. They still want you to pay full price for a ticket, when not able to offer the full complement of rides. No fast passes available the one day. Won’t be returning in a hurry. Extortionate food and drink prices, Christmas market in the village a total joke. This is my fourth and last visit here."
Disappointed...,"We’ve been to Disneyland Paris a few times over the years and generally have had good experiences. However, the same cannot be said for this time. We were lucky enough to go to Walt Disney World this summer (August 2019) and had an amazing time there. The cast members cannot do enough for you there but not so in DLP. I hated having to use an app to book to see some characters as if I want to see a character, I like to be able to queue s and not have to be in the park early enough to try and get a time slot. Unfortunately, we were unsuccessful using the app and missed out on seeing some characters. We went to queue to see Jack Skellington as the app wasn’t working for him but we were told at 4:10pm that the queue was closed as he had to leave at 5pm, when it said in the programme that he would be able to be seen until 5pm. To me that means you can queue up until 5pm and then the queue would be shut. My daughter started crying and the cast members eventually took pity on her and let us join the queue and then closed it again at 4:20pm. However, people with the green disability pass we’re allowed to enter their queue after the queue was closed to the general public. I found that very unfair as the queue should be closed to everyone if they’re going to close it early. We wanted to go and complain but there was a massive queue to get into City Hall. Generally I just found people to be really rude, especially at the parade time, with a lot of pushing and shoving from behind. We won’t be rushing back and would prefer to save for WDW."
Disappointing Visit to Disneyland Paris,"We visited Disneyland Paris as a birthday treat for our 10-yearlong son. During our seven hours stay, we managed 3 rides. Average queuing time stated 60 minutes, though in practice the waits were longer. I guess you come to expect this at theme parks if you’re not paying the exorbitant extra for Fast Track, but given the weather was bitterly cold, one would have expected some form of heating to keep the punters warm whilst they waited for their ride. Not so, we queued and queued and queued and slowly but surely our body temperatures dropped. Thoughts of Earnest Shackleton came to mind as our fingers and toes became numb, but at least Shackleton had the luxury of movement, we were hemmed in like cattle to the slaughter. By the time we eventually made it on to our ride, the will to live had all but deserted us and any thrill factor was severely tempered by the fear of pending frostbite.
So, with extremities now painfully cold, we headed for the nearest cafe in the hope of hot coffee and food, oh, but wait a minute, was that another queue we see? Yep, people are queuing outside to get into the cafe. Resolute, we soldiered on in search of somewhere less busy, but alas, our search was in vain, everywhere was ridiculously busy. Desperate for nourishment and a warming drink, we resolved to join yet another queue and 30 minutes later we were served. But, wait a minute, how much are the hot dogs? Seriously, 9 euros each! So, were the “best hot dogs outside the USA” really that good? Well, no actually, they were pretty awful and the coffee was cold and insipid. To add insult to injury, there were no seats, so, we had to walk back out into the bitingly cold weather. Over priced, fast food in hand, we searched desperately for for somewhere to rest and eat. Eventually we joined a group of fellow visitors, huddled on the floor in a complex of shops - not ideal but slightly warmer than outside!!
Despite an essentially awful day, our son put on a brave face and tried to hide his disappointment, after all, he’d only been waiting six months for his dream trip to Disneyland and when all said and done, the experience was, to put it mildly, a disappointment.
All I can say is, Disneyland, you can do better! People pay a lot of money to get into your theme park and we expect much better. Allowing more people than you seem able to cope with is a recipe for disaster, and believe me, there were far too many people. Then, once you’ve achieved packing in as many people as possible, you rip them off by charging ridiculous money for poor standard food. On top of that, you allow your visitors to freeze whilst queuing to go on rides.
In short, Disneyland Paris, care less about maximising your profit and more about giving people a truly good time, that they will cherish and remember fondly for years to come. We will definitely remember our Disneyland experience, but, I’m sad to say, for all the wrong reasons."
Magical,"I can not describe in words this place and I’m not even a fan of rides !
The costumes and details are great everyone everywhere is in character!
Really clean
Although frightfully expensive is take a packed lunch next time . The Disneyland app is great and works well
The parade and illuminations are must see activities"
Go out of season on a week day....,"Had 3 day hopper ticket, stayed in a Disney hotel (group booking, so got reasonable price) got in park early on a Friday morning for the ‘magic hour’. Made good use out of it, getting on the big rides before the queues built up. Managed to ‘do’ the whole park in the day. It wasn’t busy and the longest queue was only around 30 mins. The illuminations were amazing, and there were fireworks around the lake in the village after and they were also great. Saturday was much busier and queues were between 60 - 85 minutes, and it seemed some of the rides (Peter Pan, small world etc) were sped up to keep queues down, so after waiting for ages, you were rushed through the ride. The fast path tickets were all gone by around 11am. Sunday was madness, there are more hotel rooms than there is space in the parks, which made the magic hour pointless as queues built up even before the park was open to the general public, and, a new ‘Marvel’ hotel is being built. Queue times were 80 min + for most rides. Lots of kids looking miserable as they were fed up of waiting. The parades are worth a watch, but, you can be trapped for the duration if you stand in the wrong place. There are lots of shops selling the same stuff, go in one and you have been in them all. Restaurants are massively expensive. Alton Towers, Chessington and Thorpe Park have better rides, and you get more bang for your buck. If you want to go to Disney, save up and go to Florida.. Paris is a poor relation."
Holiday,We had a lovely time lots to see and do and most rides were working was lovely to see the park ready for Christmas with decs and also day of the dead decs better system of meet and greets we was unable to book into seeing the princesses and Mickey Mouse a soft play area would be lovely for little ones to be able to have a run around in safety
Daughters Birthday,We came to the park over 2 days and the park is lovely. The parade and fireworks display was amazing. The ques were quite bad for a lot of rides and also to meet the characters. We used the early pass with staying at a Disney hotel which was definitely worth while! All I would say is not many BIG rides for older kids or adults which I thought there would be! Overall great visit and would return for sure
Brillant once in a lifetime experience,Celebrated our sons birthday absolutely spotless park was amazing would recommend it to anyone only downside was food a bit pricey
Too many bad points to give 5/5,"We had an enjoyable trip here, we had a 3 day ticket for both parks and felt there wasn’t enough to fill the time to we repeated some of the rides.
Disneyland is just magical and amazing so we would return but Florida is 10x better.
I list some bad points below which were annoying and would have made my rating 5/5 if they were fixed.
Bad points:
- The cast members do not compare to those in Florida. They made the holiday memorable in Florida but here Some of them were just rude here.
- While we were on 5 different rides they broke down and we had to be evacuated.
- The app didn’t display all the shows and parades happening which meant we missed the 2 daytime parades and a show in videopolis.
- Queue time on the Saturday was crazy! Do not visit on a Saturday unless you have to. It was an extra hour atleast on every ride.
- So many people walking round with selfie sticks despite the ban and relentless reminders over the park tannoys.
- So many people smoking around the park despite the ban and relentless reminders over the park tannoys. This wasn’t ideal as I’m pregnant and spent a lot of time dodging people’s smoke.
- Reservations for Plaza Gardens and Billy Bobs restaurants are pointless because you end up having to wait in the queue with people who haven’t booked!"
LOVELY but..,"We stayed for 3 nights in November 2019 and we really enjoyed it. However, there are a few things we wished we had known BEFORE booking.
1) We didn’t know there were apps you can download that specify the wait times for rides or if they were interrupted or if they were closed. Which were usually accurate! We only discovered the app on our last full day.
2) Book the restaurants in advance. We got to dine at California Grill and for 2 people it cost us €185. This included 2 cocktails, 1 glass of red wine, 2 main courses and 1 dessert. Service is not included from what I saw on the receipt.
The food was good, not Michelin star quality but a significant improvement on the fried food in the parks and Disney village. Veggie options are limited. Service is very attentive.
3) We wouldn’t have booked the dates we did if we had known 3 of the major rides were closed or had consistent technical difficulties. For example, Indiana Jones was closed for refurbishment, Thunder Mountain had 60minute waits because of a technical issue and then closed and Star Tours was also delayed. It would have been nice to have taken advantage of all rides not just some. However I’d also prefer to be safe not sorry.
Food wise in the parks expect long lines for food and expect it to set you back €15.99 for a burger, chips and drink meal in some of the fast food joints. They do have McDonald’s at the end of Disney Village...and King Ludwigs was good. Fish and Chips was nice! Popcorn is around the €6 and a bottle of water starts at €3. But we expected as much.
It pays to buy the park tickets beforehand and ask at the desks if they can print it for you. We bought directly through the Disney website. On the gate it’s at least €10/20 more.
Regarding the hotel we stayed at Disneyland Paris Hotel in the park. It was lovely, feels very magical as all the Christmas decorations were up. Although it’s slightly dated you don’t mind because it’s so lovely to look at. The staff are really attentive and friendly. Especially in Cafe Fantasia on the 2nd floor. Cocktails start at €19. Glowtini was nice! BUT, the biggest issue for us was Planet Hollywood. We had dinner their and within a few hours my partner had an upset stomach. TMI...we think it might have been the beef burger. Either way it effected the day after because we couldn’t do as much as we hoped. Although the waitress who served us was nice.
Personally we did enjoy our stay but my partner was a bit miffed that we had spent a lot of money and the park tickets aren’t included in the price, which we think they should be if you’re staying at the Disney Hotel. Besides that, we recommend if you’re going in the winter months, bring comfy shoes, warm jacket and if you can your own food!"
Overrated and overpriced,"Disneyland is for many a dream, but the reality is not very sweet. Make sure you get there early and do all attractions, because when it peaks around lunch it quickly gets between 1 - 2 hour waiting time for the most popular attractions.. even on off season.
You can get fast pass, and perhaps only wait 20 minutes. Getting a coffee took me 45 min, and it was only 10 in line before me. I strongly recommend to bring your own food because finding a restaurant that’s not already booked is a struggle.
The entrance fee is quite pricey compared to e.g. Legoland in Denmark, and most everything there. But now it’s done and checked off the bucket list.
Plus points for Disneyland Village and how easy it was to get to this place though."
Magical...........NO,"Please take this onboard and DO NOT waste your money, save up and goto Florida!
This place is very poor! I resent every penny of the £5K I spent on my 3 night break. I have nothing positive to say, apart from they are consistent! The response just received to my letter of complaint was as bad as my stay.......well done Disney!"
It’s Disney - superb,I am not massively into Disney but my partner is. Really enjoyed the visit as there is so much to do.
Not worth it,"Aside from guests' poor behavior, I was shocked to see and have a subpar experience. Guests allowing their children to urinate in bushes instead of leaving a line, throwing trash, cutting lines, etc., which is out of Disney's control, but this is where I expected a Walt Disney World/Disneyland California experience knowing Disney has certain expectations of their cast members and parks.
1. Many rides broken down. (One scheduled refurbish. We stopped trying to go on attractions when we got to a 4th broken down attraction.)
2. Attraction wait times were extremely inaccurate. A 15 minute wait for TOT ended up being an hour. A 30 minute wait at Haunted Mansion ended up being over an hour.
3. It took 40 minutes to get food at Casey’s Corner and the line was not long. I had 2 people in front of me from the moment I entered the line.
4. Most of the food vendors were closed.
5. A cast member sold us park tickets while on a personal phone call the entire time.
6. No enforcement for people to smoke in designated areas or enforcement of selfie stick ban.
7. Multiple areas in need of repair/maintenance. There were areas where someone could injure themselves and the park would be responsible.
8. Sidewalk movers not operating.
9. Poor signage to attractions, exits, etc.
We had purchased a 2 day park hopper for the 5 of us. We spent a few hours the first day and never went back. Using the 2nd day was not worth our time. This bad experience made me appreciate Walt Disney World even more than we already do and we cannot wait until our next visit to Walt Disney World in 2 months."
Fantastic time for the family,"Our trip to Disneyland was amazing. Our family really enjoyed the whole experience. Park is wonderful, rides are super and the cleanliness and atmosphere is great. Why the drop in one star? Basically it’s the remarkably slow service at the food stations and the ludicrous prices. Don’t get me wrong the overall experience is brilliant but one person selling crepes in a cabin when there really needs to be 3 is pushing it to plain disrespecting the customers. But that aside I would recommend Disney Paris and hope to return some day."
Family fun,Disneyland Paris is just great fun for all the family .Rides such as Big thunder mountain and Pirates of the Caribbean are not to be missed .Best time to visit are week days as weekends are very busy with long queues. Use fastpass for some rides will save you a lot of time.
WORTH GOING,"We had the most amazing two days at Disneyland Paris. All the rides were amazing and meeting Mickey was the highlight to my kids. I loved the haunted house, pirate drive through village and actually everything. The Stars on Parade were wonderful and the Fireworks absolutely breathtaking. Amazing, amazing. Worth going!"
Long time to wait for a 2 minute ride,"They sell way to many tickets per day. That causes long lines for every ride. If you go during the summer, it is extremely hot to wait 50-70 minutes for a ride that is finished in a few minutes. After a long day filled with wasted time waiting, I felt cheated!"
Committed,"The forecast stated three days of rain showers during our stay in Paris. Compared to other Disney parks stateside the prices were actually quite reasonable. Although it did rain during our visit, we made the best of it. If it is on your bucket list, I would recommend at least a two day stay. Enjoyed our time there. Plan on walking 12 to 15 thousand steps a day."
Be sure to stay for the night fireworks,"This is great fun for the whole family, but be sure to stay for the fireworks at the end of the day. Now I've seen fireworks from all over the world, but Disneyland Paris eclipses them all."
Disney is always a joy,"Disneyland Paris is a hop skip and jump away from Paris Via the RER train. What a convenient way to and from the park.
Hyperspace Mountain was insane. The launch up the first hill to drop into the mountain was unexpected. It's dark. It's fast. It's loud. It has a loop and corkscrews. Literally no idea what's happening but it's amazing and I wish the one back home in California even compared to the thrills here in Paris.
Thunder Mountain was so much fun too. The stations on the edge of the lake and the ride is on an island. what better way to get there then drop down into a completely black tunnel. The finale comes off a drop into a tunnel that feels like you drop forever and you come flying out the other side on land. This rides so much fun when it zips down by the water.
Pirates of the Caribbean is well done. The theming is good. The costumes and treasures look good. The drops are ok.
The park is smaller so you can definitely do both parks in 1 day. The hours of operation are pretty short but have a blast."
Brilliant,Disney is Disney and you get what you expect. The only down point is the queue's because the fast track passes are very very pricey and when you stay in the hotels you can only use your key card once to get a fast track pass. So choose what you want to go on wisely. Everything is ridiculously pricey but you need to plan your budget for that. I would recommend if your in one of the hotel getting there early before the park opens to avoid queue's etc. The staff we encountered were all really lovely. Main street is fabulous and the shops are lovely. Like I say Disney is Disney so its amazing
The best as always!,"There is a reason we are annual pass holders.
I absolutely love this place and am always happy to see the DLH hotel upon arrival.
Yes it’s expensive, yes wait times are long, yes it’s filled with lots of self centred and arrogant people and there’s a lot of wandering around but if you can’t find the fun in this place your soul is black."
Massive Letdown,"Received the trip to Disney as a birthday present, and I must say it was the biggest let down, got the bus from the Eiffel Tour and arrived at the park at 9am ish grabbed some breakfast in McDonalds which seems to be the only restaurant open at that time after which we headed into the park and this is where the disappointment begins.
The best way I can describe it is overpriced restaurants and souvenir shops with queues for miles. Saw 3 characters which had to be queued for to get a picture taken for up to an hour or more and the queues were already long at this stage, tried to go on a couple of the rides with out free pass which was included in our ticket but was told our ticket was not valid so didn’t bother after about 3. Left the park after 2 hours picked up a couple of souvenirs and headed back into the city and did some site seeing. Thankfully I experienced without kids as I think being stuck in queues for hours with kids would be an absolute nightmare"
Very good experience,"Found all staff friendly and helpful (we went during half-term)
Park was not overcrowded (apart from events and after events the traffic of people)
Stayed at the Davy Crockett (also very recommended place - as you get free parking worth 30 Eur - and free fast passes)
Best of all Disney helped us through the trauma of the Thomas Cook collapse by ensuring the booking was done and Le Shuttle booked. (the IHG credit card company was of zero help in this matter)"
Disney Halloween Holiday,"I arrived at Disney Sunday for 4 nights 5 days and left on Halloween at tea time via Euro Star. I travelled with my daughter 7 and stayed at NewPort Bay Hotel. I can honestly say that I received lovely customer service from the minute I arrived at the hotel, We had a free room upgrade and chocolate coins for my daughter I believe people call it Fairy Dust! The swimming was not over crowded and provided free towels and I personally did not find the changing rooms dirty. The breakfast was a bit stressful because I was there as a single parent and it was very busy. I had a Green
pass because I have a medical condition so we didn’t have to queue for rides and you get a time slot for the characters in the park if you see a cast member at 10am in the designated Areas. The Wild West show was great food was not that wonderful but the show made up for it. We ate in McDonald’s for 13 euros each day it was very nice and hot!! we eat in the Rain Forest Cafe and Annettes Dinner and they were awful cold and too busy. Toilets and streets were always clean in the day. The Halloween parade was really well done. Over all me and my daughter had a fantastic time. I personally found the staff friendly and helpful but there are always one or two rude people where ever you go! The one thing I found disgusting was the pushing and shoving by adults to children regarding parades, characters and food come on guys it should be about the kids not adult how selfish! And yes the French do not seem queue which is frustrating at time. I would give our holiday 8 out of 10"
Mixed review,"Our group consisted of three 50+ yr olds and my 23 yo daughter who had been a cast member in WDW Orlando for 12 months in 2017. I mention this association with WDW as it puts into context much of my review. We had expectations that Disney was just that and would be the same regardless of location and this is not so.
Luckily we booked 5 days, staying on property although a lot of reviews advised that this was too long, we were grateful for the extra time we had planned and the 1.5 hours of early entry that comes with staying in a Disney hotel.
We planned according to the wait times and fast passes and after the first day of trying to get a quick lunch in Cafe Hyperion we booked into Agrabah Cafe and Chez Remy and enjoyed excellent service in a calm and relaxed atmosphere that was much quicker than the so called quick service. We did pay a little extra in Chez Remy than our meal plan allowed but it was so worth it, the staff were exceptional in both restaurants.
The parks were crowded over the weekend, lessening on the Tuesday and Wednesday so I would advise to go midweek if you can. There were maybe 4 or 5 cast members that displayed the Disney values, for the most part the cast members were disinterested and displayed poor communication skills and lack of knowledge of their workplace. Guests smoked all over the park, unchallenged except by other guests with small children or allergies, cast members just ignored this was occurring. We waited for the last show of the evening with the fireworks and as the show started it was abruptly stopped and an announcement that the show was cancelled, as we left the park, the show suddenly recommenced without announcement - the crowd was uncontrolled, people were scrambling for a view and many children were distressed with the crowd congestion, the situation was very poorly handled. The lines and ride loading was hit and miss, the standout was the cast members on Crush’s Coaster and the ratatouille ride, they ensured all seats were full by managing the single rider line very effectively. The photopass system is extremely clumsy, it just takes too long to line up to scan your photos onto your account and is totally reliant on the guest remembering the photo number. Some of our photos didn’t load and were then not retrievable because we couldn’t remember the number.
The Halloween decorations were lovely and the parades a highlight of our days.
We enjoyed our time and had the opportunity to experience everything as we had time and I am glad we had this experience but I doubt we will be back, it was not quite as magical as WDW Magic Kingdom or California Disneyland."
"Huge disappointment at horror prices - Óriási csalódás, horror áron","We went to Disneyland Paris on a rainy November day. One million people, one and a half hours of waiting for two to three minutes of cheap experience. There are everywhere long queue, even for food or toilets. There were no such masses before. The place has reached the point where only the company is happy to operate, so many people that park simply cannot accept. I'll save you a few hundred euros: don't go to Disneyland Paris, it'll be bad. Esős novemberi napon mentünk el a párizsi Disneylandbe. Egymillió ember, másfél órás várakozások két-három percnyi vurstli élményért. Ennivalóért, wc-ért is sokat kell sorba állni. Korábban nem voltak ilyen tömegek. A hely elért arra a pontra, ahol már csak a vállalatnak jelent örömet a működés, ennyi embert egyszerűen nem tud a hely fogadni. Megspórolok önnek párszáz eurót: ne menjen a Disneylandbe, rossz lesz."
"Good Trip , but not what I was Expecting","I Visited Disneyland with family , which included three under 5s from 24th October to the 28th October. I found it to be a mixed experience with some good and bad experiences throughout my stay.
Good things included...
Fantastic illuminations bought back memories of Disney I had as a Child.
Food was buffet style so could try new foods and fill up till next meal, this was handy with three under 5s and two who are fussy eaters.
Variety of shops on Main Street and throughout the park.
There were many characters located throughout the Disney park.
Queue times for rides were reduced largely in the evening, which I recommend to queue up for as we managed get on seven or eight rides.
A lot off the staff were friendly and helpful and We found it really good how they could recognise we spoke English , although we attempted speak few words in French like bonjour and Merci. Especially how they could translate from French to English Straight away.
Bad Things...
We found the halloween party not to be well advertised and found it to be overpriced at 60 euros each when already pay a lot of money for the holiday. Based on reviews Im glad we didn't pay extra.
A lot of the staff seemed to be stressed that a lot of them came across quite rude at times , as well as other guests in the parks , which sort of ruined the magic a bit.
The queueing system for the shuttle bus from are hotel was horrendous , I feel there definitely needs to be crowd control in place as it was every person for themselves. This caused a young girl to be almost pushed out of her wheelchair as well as several other guest to be pushed out the way when they were waiting for the bus first. An injury could have happened if the crowd for the bus got out of hand. It was the same for the parade with a lot of people pushing and tuting when politely asking them to get through, or to get out of the way, resulting in several people arguing ,including myself to get easily annoyed as kept getting pushed, causing me fall into other people, who then started get angry with me.
Also there was uneven ground throughout the park not great when a park advertises it self as accessible friendly.
The bridge by the pirates of the Carribean ride has missing wood , causing my nephew to fall over really hurting himself as metal pins were sticking out. This needs sorting before anyone else gets hurt or falls over.
The hotel we stayed in was Santa Fe , which was ok clean and tidy but found dust under the fan ventilator and by the T.V. I know it was not a luxury Hotel but you expect it to be all clean and tidy not bits of dust of the floor or by the T.V
Overall I would say it was a good holiday but I don't expect staff to be rude when asking about queries or information. I don't expect everything to be perfect but again paying a lot of money for a trip we won't do for a long time , we expect at least a good customer/guest service. I would recommend going during quieter times such as January maybe or save up and go to Walt Disney World Orlando as I feel I had a much better experience in the park although was several years ago.
Im not sure if I will visit DisneyLand Paris again , based on my recent experience, But again this was our first visit to to Disneyland Paris."
More civilised than LA but simply lacking in the abilities to deal with huge crowds,"I came here with my father and brother for two days as part of our week long trip to Paris. As a Disney groupie, French Disneyland was a ‘must see’ attraction to me especially as I’ve been to the LA one and developed a taste for Disneyland.
One thing I liked about French Disneyland is the walkways and thoroughfares seem to be a lot less crowded making it seem more civilised than the LA one. In the two days I was there, I saw one mobility scooter, two wheelchairs and a handful of prams; at the LA one, it seemed like > 50% of patrons used mobility scooters and if not those, huge prams. Both of which took away seating when people used benches/seating areas as ‘parking lots.’
Another thing was the Walt Disney backlot studios It resembles Hollywood/Buena Vista and has rides that you wouldn’t otherwise find at the traditional Disneyland. For example, the 3D Ratatouille ride; I really felt like I was Remy and part of the film.
The reasons I’ve rated the park 3 and not 5 stars:
1) Lack of abilities to deal with large crowds - although the walkways are less crowded than LA, every single eatery was overly crowded. I went into a little corner deli on Main St and it took 30-40 minutes to pay for my 2 croissants; Dad tried to get a hot dog from an eatery in Fantasyland yet gave up when it looked like there’d be an hour long wait for service. The upshot: we didn’t even get to enjoy one meal there and ended up bringing our own food the second day, which was really disappointing.
I don’t know if it was due to staff shortages or what but something needs to change with service to get customers served more promptly and reduce wait times.
2) Limited range of Disney clothes and jewellery. Apart from a few t-shirts and hoodies, there just wasn’t the range of Disney clothes that the LA theme park sold. I would’ve loved to have been able to buy some more nice Disney dresses like the one I bought in LA.
3) Fast passes - very few available for rides and even then, the cues looked to be 30+ minutes just to get to the machines."
Too many problems to be magical.,"Eight of us booked a 3 day Disneyland ticket. Unless money is no object, it’s expensive. We decided we needed 3 days as the children are aged between 1 and 14 so we would be looking for rides to keep everyone happy.
Day 1 - first disappointment was that parking is €30 per car (€180 for 2 cars over 3 days - I have always thought it wrong to be charged for parking) we arrived about 9:15. No travelators working so quite a long walk for little legs. It then took over an hour to get into the park as the swipe facility at the entrance had problems with everyone in front of us. Of course by then all the rides had queues of over an hour. Also no working drinking fountains towards the entrance or in the first park of the park.
The behind the scenes tour and stunt show were both enjoyed by all. Crush coaster was advertising a 30 minute wait, so a bit disappointed it took an hour to get on the ride.
We then headed to the main park and found out that a large number of rides were closed so people were going to those that were open making ridiculous waiting times on what was open. We timed some of the children’s rides such as Dumbo it was 90 second ride from start to finish with a 70 minute wait. The constant queueing took its toll on the younger ones so we headed off quite early
Day two. We decided not to try and beat the crowds. Another wrong decision, all the fast passes had run out on the main rides. We had no choice but join the main queues. We managed a total of 4 rides - that’s about £15 a ride. That is scandalous. Peter Pan and Thunder mountain had 2 hour queues, thank goodness for the paddle steamer where we got on in the advertised 15 minutes. Haunted house advertised 35 minute wait, over an hour before entering the house. We all enjoyed the parade and illuminations at the end of the day for those of us who stayed. We filmed it and it was 20 minutes (other reviews were saying it was only 10 minutes)
Day 3. Sat in a slow moving queue to get parked and suddenly a stream of traffic came in from the top of the car park. Filling in all the closer spaces with nothing the staff could do - maybe Disney should invest in something a little more effective than a traffic cone that can just be moved. Last day and Halloween party so carefully planned out the day. All agreed the younger children could do the Toy Story area rides after the earlier parade yet on our arrival at the studios we find they were closing. So that’s a lot of disappointed children.
After eating we went back to watch the illuminations. We selected a spot that was far enough from the front for the one who doesn’t like fireworks. From the moment the street lights went out we were pushed and shoved and spent an uncomfortable 30 minutes protecting the children from people shoving past. On the way put it looked like the studio may be reopening but by then we were all too exhausted and just wanted to get away from the crowds.
We queued on average 10-15 minutes any time someone needed the toilet. Surprised Disney hasn’t any gender neutral toilets that would certainly help, many women were using the men’s. Also surprised to see a total lack of recycling bins - time to catch up with the rest of the world.
So the travelators didn’t work the whole time we were there. Lots of rides were closed the whole time we were there (including the train round the park) which put too much pressure on the other rides. I don’t believe that Disney can’t get rides repaired and working, there is no excuse. We also had rides develop faults and temporarily close - small world and Dumbo as we were waiting. Forgot to mention queues to meet characters averaged an hour.
So you want some sort of compensation, join a queue of hundreds that lead to a single person (what a sole destroying job!). Life is too short to wait in another Disney queue.
The two stars are because all of the children have taken away happy memories, from an adult perspective it is hard to award a single star."
!!!,"I just dont know from where To start this review ....I will go with main parking lots overcrowded wondering around to find some spot until we found some spots on the parking lot roof,I must add it was quite pricey around 20€ but I don’t judge that as it’s perfectly normal for a top location as this ,also the food around the park was expensive as well 45€ for a stake ,but pretty much depends what you wanna eat and where some places have cheaper stuff like fries and chicken ,don’t think it’s really cheap but around 20€ which is acceptable .park was having all kind of amusement rides but it would take a lot of patience if you wanna ride them as the waiting time can be ....well ..a lot !that much that you don’t want to ride anything anymore .and all these weren’t the problem at all these were the good parts .the thing that shocked me was another...as you all know around the park you will find you favourite characters dressed fluffy and everything and you can stay with them and do pictures to have a nice memory when you get home ...well that wasn’t the case for us...our friends brought their 8 year daughter with them and along the way we found Pluto so obviously the child wanted a picture with him and not only her the other parents and kids that were near us around 20 people ,he was just not bothered by it,he came waved and run from the crowd which I found it extremely rude .you are paid to do exactly that !to wonder around park and do pics with people and you disappoint some kids that started to cry because you didn’t had 10 seconds to stay for a pic ..even I was disappointed not to mention all the kids .i was really happy being there and explore but this left me a bitter taste of the experience .other than this is fine ...reminds you how it is to be a kid again"
"HORRIFIC , HORRIFIC , HORRIFIC","I don't know how DISNEY can put its name to this horrific place .No customer service , no service of any kind .
NOT DISNEY .Do not waste a penny going to Euro Disney. Please, Please save and go to the real thing in America .
Euro Disney is dirty ,Cast members are unhelpful ,we asked a cast member where the nearest loo was and he shrugged his shoulders and walked away!!!!!! DO NOT GO HERE YOU WILL REGRET IT !!!!!!!!!"
Disappointing and not worth the hours of queues!,"We were excited to experience a day at Disneyland but left feeling extremely disappointed and fed up. During the day we spent about 4-5 hours in lines (getting into the venue, rides, lunch) and only managed to go on 2 rides despite using the fast pass option. The park is beautiful and seems well maintained but this doesn't make up for the fact that there were just way too many people and so it's hard to enjoy yourself when you're waiting in lines for the whole day.
My top tips for the saving some time would be:
1) Print out your tickets. We only bought tickets after arriving in Paris so didn't have the option. Although the ticket readers can scan phones it takes longer and is often quite slow.
2) Pack lots of snacks +/- lunch. Saves heaps of times/money lining up for food
3) Arrive early (it seems that even thought the official opening time is 10am, the gates actually opened at 9.30am) and have a game plan for which rides you want to go on!"
Expensive & overcrowded,"DisneyLand is a small theme park that is a victim of its own success. It seems no matter how much they charge to get in, or once you're in there, people flock to it. This means it's very busy, and very expensive.
They do the fast pass, but when we went (Halloween to be fair) it sees everyone has it. We managed to book fast pass on one ride, then all the slots were full for the other rides. Then of course hey have 2 further higher tariffs, push in tickets!
Overall 2 adults, and 2 kids (3&9years) £280 to get in just one of the 2 parks, (if paid in advance, yes it's dearer this time of year than normal), then 50 Euro on 2 burger and chips with extra nuggets for the kids for lunch, and 40 euro for tea, 3 hotdogs. And of course 30 euro just to park!!! And don't plan on sitting down to eat, we were one of the lucky ones who found a wall next to a bin!
Expect a single day in the park, (not the additional evening do on Halloween that again is more, and not to go on the studies park that's extra ) to set you back around £400! Assuming you don't buy anything else, is ice-cream, toys etc. The balloons they sell are 10 euros each.
Well we got there just after opening, and managed, 2 rides, 2 goes on the 3d cinema, met Pluto, watched the parade, and then the fireworks (albeit we were almost in the carpark for that because of how busy it is!)
That said, it would've a wonderful little park for kids to enjoy, clean, what we saw of the rides they look good, it's simply ruined by the volume of people, and ridiculous costs. They could improve this by limiting the number of tickets, but then why would they?
I sadly would recommend staying away. Even if you have very young children and an visit out of season, the costs are not justified. It really is about an eighth of the size of say Alton towers, a tenth of the rides, and four times the costs."
Most expensive queue you can imagine,"We wanted to surprise our son with a day at Disneyland. He'd previously loved the trip to Anaheim and when he was two (he doesn't remember that), we had a great time at Disney World. This park is slightly different, and it's not just the October cold, but maybe this is the reason: there is a lot less activity in the park itself, and quite a few things are closed. But there are a lot of visitors and the queues for the attractions are neverending. We chose a fastpass to one of our son's favorite character rides and were then locked out from choosing any other passes until that was done. We chose Space Mountain and the single rider queue which was announced as 35', opposed to the 70' for the regular queue. We waited for exactly 70'. I can only imagine how long the regular queue was. Given that one in our party didn't tag along, it was an excruciating wait. Two rides, that's all we managed. We also queued for a restaurant only to learn it was fully booked. Then we queued another half-hour for a fast-food restaurant with disgusting and overpriced food. Happiest place on earth? Well, I think your local or regional amusement park has better rides and shorter queues. If you've done Disney once, you really have no reason to return. It's just not worth the money."
La touche magique?,"Paris has just about upheld the good reputation of Disney here it it is very much Le Cousin Pauvre to its USA counterparts. The theming, animateurs, and workforce just as excellent - friendly, talented, welcoming. BUT the magic hour doesn’t work as it should when several major rides all malfunction for several hours, the park turfs guests out for a Halloween party meaning it closes 3 hours earlier than usual and then closes the toilets in several areas way before then too. Not helpful. Its management of large crowds is questionable and one wonders if they’ve heard of crowd crushing at events when you funnel people into one area...
Food at DLP is the antithesis of good French food - any French person would be ashamed. Take lots of snacks in with you!!!
No hot water in most toilet facilities - a real shame and unhygienic; especially in baby change.
Massive queues at busy times but that’s life.
Some great parades, shows and iconic rides but needs some TLC in many areas of the park.
Great to note lots of water fountains & everyone is lovely to kids as you would hope and plenty of child friendly facilities.
Fireworks & illuminations of castle were simply outstanding though - do not miss! Merci pour la magique pour mes enfants, DLP.
MGM - such a shame the theatre that used to have Mickey & the Magician is not in use as no show at the moment."
School trip to Disney,"I hadn’t been to Disneyland Paris for 6 years before I went as a media trip with my college. I was not disappointed and had the most amazing time, even as a 17 year old my inner child came out and I was as excited as any child would be. Lovely food, lovely atmosphere and the rides were worn down but still amazing and I plan to come back very soon!"
You won't be disappointed if you love Disney,"If you love Disney, you have to go. There is some definitely similarities between the classic Disneyland and this park, but there are also some definite differences. I enjoyed the Paris Haunted Mansion for its creepy storyline. Big Thunder seemed longer. The mango whips were delicious.
Please note that people don't speak English nearly as much as you might expect. They're helpful and nice because they're Disney employees, still, and not at all rude.
Pin trading in this park is very different than Disneyland. Very few people wore lanyards and traded. Very few shops had pin boards (or, I was asking very wrong). However, many employees had lanyards and happily traded. Plus, there was a huge area set up with tables full of people trading from books. So, just different."
Disneyppointing,"Very Disappointing visit we had last week, two of us traveling from Spain and only getting 3 days away from work to arrive to this land in which 3 of the main 4 attractions were closed, not even the fast-pass was able to “jump” the 55 minutes waiting cue to get to any other, we did both parks in one day even tho we bought the 2 days-pass....and I don’t recommend to go either to the steak house restaurant, food was served cold and we had to ask 3 different waiters to bring one tiny slice of lemon which had only skin :D Amazing!!!"
Loved it!,"Loved the Dragon under the castle. Every castle should have a dragon. We loved all the rides, cast members, and the ability to see everything. The weather was cool and the crowds were nonexistent. Loved all the Halloween decorations. The only weird thing was that everything was old west for America??"
Hideously busy and way too expensive.,Paid just short of £300 for a day at Disney with our 9 and 7 year olds. It was absolutely heaving so we barely got on anything. I just don't get how they can fill it to what feels like some way beyond capacity and charge a fortune for it. Left a couple of hours early.
Dont Bother Not Quite As Magical As They Say,"Visited Disneyland Paris for Halloween, we were so excited to be going here, after all it's Disneyland, What a let down.
I new it wouldn't be anything like Halloween at Florida, which we have done, but this was a joke.
Not much to say it was Halloween, the show off the day lasted 10 minutes also the one parade of the day.
Most of the good rides closed for reburbishment, or were not working. No Characters walking around. It was queing to see or do anything,
Restaurants most were closed down, and the snack stops closed down at 6pm. No cups to buy, and get free fill ups.
Not to mention there are a few toilets which are dirty, and a few places to sit.
This wasnt the Halloween experience we was looking for, no atmosphere, the staff had no smiles on their face or desire to serve anyone. It was a shambles.
Please dont waste your money, I wouldn't recommend Disneyland Paris to anyone. Save up and go to Florida, and get the real experience."
Magical holiday,"I visited with my partner, 5 year old daughter & 8month old daughter for a 5 night break staying on site in a Disney hotel. We had an amazing time the whole family really enjoyed the Disney experience & the magic of the park & all the experiences. There are lots of rides catering for children and families & staying in a Disney hotel we had the advantage of fast passes. These need to be planned out in advance as the popular rides will book up fast so taking the time to plan your day ahead is well worth it. While we were there it was the jungle jive performance 4 times daily which was excellent. The Disney stars on parade was also good but not as entertaining as the jungle jive. It is well worth booking character dining as meeting characters & princesses in the park will easily cost you a few hours of queueing time per character. There is a huge variety of restaurants & food outlets within the park but lacking in choice for younger diners. Recommend the Peter Pan ride & pirates of the Caribbean. All in all an excellent break & we will definitely be returning."
Amazing,Had so much fun on a 2 day park visit. Have booked to go 3 more times. The experience was amazing and magical every second. Didn't find the queues to bad either.
"Queueseyland, Paris","I am a big Disney fan, and this was probably visit 8 or 9. The thrill of entering the park and walking down Main Street is still as strong as ever.
That said I will never visit during October half term again, as even ‘Magic’ has to be better organised.
I expect queues for rides. They can’t invent extra rides just because it is busy. Due to the Indiana Jones and Aerosmith rides being closed for maintenance, Hyperspace Mountain being unexpectedly closed for 4 out of our 6 days, Big Thunder Mountain and other rides out of action for shorter periods, there was huge pressure on the working rides.
On several occasions the queue time for Big Thunder Mountain was 180 minutes. No ride is worth that length of wait. It is hard for children and even able bodied adults struggle to stand for that period. There are various special arrangements for people with health problems, which, although understandable, inevitably add to the wait for the feet aching masses.
I really think that Disney like queues. It was incredibly busy, so why not open cafe Hyperion for breakfast? We had to go out of the park to the studios for this. We didn’t have vouchers, we paid the full price, and expected more choice. Why where there closed popcorn and snack stalls? The queues for the open ones stretched across pathways and made getting about even more difficult.
We were 5th or 6th in line for ice creams in one of the Main Street shops. It took over 25 minutes! All the staff had to do was put 2 or 3 scoops into a cardboard container. Yes, several people ordered more than one, but at one stage there were 5 members of staff behind the counter. The main qualities that Disney seems to demand of its shop employees are tardiness and sullenness. Several frustrated customers were shouting at the staff about the delays, and how hard can their job be, which was unpleasant for everyone.
The staff on the rides are normally quite good, but why force two of them to stand out in the cold for days on end, answering questions about why the Space mountain ride was closed? They didn’t know! Securely close the ride entrance gates and put up a sign for people to read!
I was lucky enough not to have queued for hours for a ride which then stopped working, but a lot of others were affected.
The fast pass ticket machines were often out of order, causing even more queues, 4 out of 5 were not functioning at the Peter Pan ride. Most of the fast pass tickets had been allocated by midday, unless we were willing to pay a huge extra sum for an unlimited fast pass.
We did manage to get on some of our favourite rides towards the park closing times as the queues had reduced a bit, but by that time we were exhausted.
We had queued well before the start of the 8.30am ‘ magic’ hour to get into the Disney studios. As soon as we got through the turnstile we all ran towards the Crushes Coaster ride, only to be dismayed to see a huge queue already snaking back. The next day we went even earlier, ran faster and still queued for over 40 minutes for the ride. The extra magic hour and special entrance for Annual passport holders do not help as much as you think they will at peak times."
More than I expected!,"It was like a dream this park extends beyond your fantasy! Everything is so beautiful, cleaned and well cared.
1. Book your tickets online one day before and you'll get the cheaper
2. The automated refrigerators were all of them out of function so you have to buy your water too expencive
3. Don.t go on the weekend as it is too crowded
4. get the app so as to see which game has the less crowd and choose wiser were to go next, or to plan your rides
5. On the closing of the night a great ceremony with parade, music, videos and fireworks take place which will take your breath"
Pah!,"Hadn’t been since kids were little- now teens.
Went there with a plan as know what it can be like.
I am a Brit.
I know how to queue- we do it well!
I appreciate the need to queue.
Every ride pretty much 75min waits. fast passes blocked or 2 hours ahead.
One section pretty much closed.
Not impressed.
Lots the will to live by 9pm. We had been there from 10:30.
Managed 6 rides only and a McDonalds.
The allergy advice on the app incorrect- restaurants denied having allergy menus.
The app was hopeless.
Lot of money spent for the frustration of queuing."
Too commercial and too many people,Disney still has it magic however in order to make the business profitable they have cxl most live shows and increased the number of customers so for any attraction you most likely wait one hr or more. Will not go back
Spoiled by queues,"Visited with my adult children. Have been to Disneyland California in 2017, have to say the Paris one is much better. The California site is choked with kiddies’ strollers to the point one cannot even sit down because the seats are hidden behind walls of strollers. And then there are the hundreds of electric disability scooters also choking the walkways - not because the riders are disabled but because they are obese Americans too lazy to walk.
There was none of this at Paris Disneyland - people and children are using their legs much more. Plus, the Paris park is cleaner. The only reason I did not give any more stars was because the queue management is broken. Huge queues on all the rides, and where Fast Track was supposed to be present, it was not.
Even the food venues had huge queues, my daughter waited for 40 MINUTES to buy two croissants. And the food was all way over-priced and poor quality. I know it is an “American-flavoured” park but I had thought the French would have lifted the standards - they did not. So, bring your own food and drinks.
Work on reducing the queues, people.
Kim W, Gippsland, Australia"
Fun weekend!,"On Saturday evening the park was so crowded it was really unpleasant to move anywhere.
There were insufficient places to eat or get anything as the Halloween evening party crowd joined the day trippers and hotel guests.
There were long queues everywhere and very little Disney magic spirit.
The firework and illuminated show was fantastic what little we could see but the kids saw even less being so small.
Sunday was pouring with rain so less people and we were in the park early.
We queued for 45 minutes to see the Disney Princesses and only saw Snow White - our girls were so disappointed - why only 1?
Other rides/ activities were really great especially Ratatouille!
The food in the Disney park is really poor - Annettes Diner - the breakfast, cold food, no atmosphere, short of staff and really shocking as was the food offer Monday morning breakfast at the Brown Derby. Saturday night in Micky cafe - so expensive but at least the children met the characters but the food was very average at €65 per adult and €35 per child.
I really feel that due to the over commercialism of the park it really has lost a lot of its Magic standards of service and hospitality Disney is famous for are definitely not evident in Disneyland France."
My bi-yearly trip,"I love going to Disneyland Paris, it has improved somuch in the years.
Perfect fun for the whole family, magical atmosphere. Few changes needed, though: all stuff should be able to speak English, food and merchandise is dramatically overpriced and queues are way too long."
Where are all the staff - toilets STINK absolutely disgusting,"Are Disneyland Paris having financial problems? Apart from entrance and attractions there are absolutely NO STAFF anywhere. There used to be street sweepers, staff to ask questions and lots of staff In the toilets. Now there are none. Halloween was a nightmare. ALL of The toilets were absolutely vile - Disney you should be ashamed of yourselves.
So many rides kept breaking down Thunder mountain, Pirates, Dumbo, space mountain and more... Queues everywhere, maybe they should limit the amount of people allowed in. Limit their income and give the customer a better experience!! Unfortunately it appears money is the prime motivation above all, sad!"
Standard Disney plus additional rides,"We visited both Disneyland Paris and Disney Studios Park in one day with a park hopper pass; 2 adults and our 2 teenaged children. We enjoyed the experience. We've been to Disneyland in California, and many of the rides are the same/very similar, but we researched in advance and focused on those that were a unique experience Big Thunder, Phantom Manor, Hyperspace Mountain, Alice's Curious Laybrinth). One day is probably not enough to see everything, but by arriving at opening and skipping attractions that we'd experienced elsewhere, we were happy with our experience. We used the (free) FastPass option but not the paid one, and also used the app which gave some information on wait times. Overall we had a great experience and enjoyed our day."
Lacks the magic,"Spent 2 days at Disneyland Paris with friends and our young children. The park is smaller than its American counterparts, but we found it to be a nice size given that we were visiting with little ones. It has all the well-known rides (small world, dumbo, thunder mountain etc.), although a significant number of attractions were closed during our visit.
Despite our overall enjoyment of the two days, several factors detracted from the overall experience. Firstly, although generally the park is well maintained, signs of disrepair are nevertheless present (dirty toilets, peeling paint on the iconic disneyland hotel etc.). Also, the level of smoking that was permitted in the park was ridiculous in this day and age. Although I appreciate that there were designated smoking areas around the park, these were interspersed amongst areas that non-smokers (and their children) may be forced to pass through (e.g. I hated having to pull my preschooler through a cloud of smoke to get to the toilets next to the park entrance). The staff at the park were generally professional, however, there were some exceptions who clearly did not share the Disney spirit (e.g. the employee who yelled at us when we attempted to exit a restaurant through a fire door that had been left open). Finally, it should be noted that the range of mid-range food options was limited, with the counter service restaurants generally serving the same fast food fare. Would have appreciated healthier takeaway options (e.g. a salad bar) to counter all the treats in the park.
All in all we enjoyed our experience of Disney in the heart of Europe, but at the same time do not feel the need to go rushing back"
Magical,"How could you ever get disappointed?
It’s everything you imagine it to be. You get so caught up in the fantasy of getting there that you forget it’s a theme park, with rides, and attractions- which means huge queues! Especially for the popular rides.
Fast track would be worth it if you can afford it. But the most popular rides have queues on fast track too. Some have times when you can use fast track.
Top tip, save your fast track money and spend it on staying at one of the Disney hotels. That way you can access the park 2 hours before the general public. Shorter queues and you can get through quite a few rides.
Be sure to stay for the illuminations show at 10pm. Totally worth it"
Absolute waste time 1hr que times .. Money grabing,"Waste of time going here, Forced to spend extra 100 eutos per day for fast pass tickets as the que times exspensive with 4 kids, massive, ridiculous 1 hr queuing all time.
Expensive ridiculous 15 pound for two cheap hot dogs, 16 pound mini mouse ears head band, everything is so over priced, very greedy disney, Chessington and Paulton Park were better for kids by far. Will not go to disney again."
This is Disneyland,"They know well how to entertain the children and their parents.
All the games are interesting.
Only drawback is the long queue.
I can’t feel my legs from standing.
Their mobile application is great.
They have free fast WI FI.
really thanks Disney."
Simply enchanting,What more could you ask for in this magical wonderland? The whole ambience of the place needed to be experienced in its entirety. Highly recommended for families of all ages - the 6 days whizzed by in no time at all. It is a good idea to do your homework before you get there to maximise what is on offer.
Amazing,"Visited with my partner at the start of October for our anniversary, we had an amazing time, we would like to say a special mention to Javier who helped make it extra special for us on our last day by helping us fill out our autograph book!"
Worse kids attraction ever,"We visited on the 26th of October.i never been any kids attraction this expensive and waiting over 2 hours for each ride. On top of everything many rides were either close or closed down while we were waiting in queue.
I would recommend Disneyland Paris to any friends, and I wouldn’t comeback again all the way from UK. There are much better parks in uk and much much cheaper and better."
Magic for all the family! (Useful tips),"I have read quite a few reviews before writing this, and yes it is busy, and yes there will be queues, but you should be prepared for this in advance - especially if you are going to go during European school holiday times!
The best bit of advice I would give you is to make sure you purchase a fast pass in advance, as this will help you avoid the queues on the major attractions. Also try and buy an early ticket so that you can experience the park for 90 minutes before the official opening hours! That way you can do the more popular non fast pass rides before everyone else can!
If you are planned, you can do the whole park in two full days (08:30 to after the light show at 22:00), during busy times, with ease. We did and we had two kids in prams! And we watched all the shows, parades and light show too...
Yes the food and drink is overpriced, and with long queues, but there is nothing stopping you taking your own food with you and eating it whilst waiting in the queues. That’s also the best use of time.
The park is always clean, so are the toilets, and it’s nice to see separate smoking areas and not happening in the queues.
There were occasions during the week when some of the attractions were shut, but I rather they did this to make sure they were safe for the next time! If you download the app then you can easily keep an eye on what’s open and also how long the queue are too! You’d be really unfortunate if you go for a day and the ride you want is shut all day.
There are 4 areas in the park;
Fantasyland is more designed for the very young, with more old fashioned style of rides and a classic Disney feel. Rides worth going on are the Peter Pan, Labrynth, It’s a Small World and Casey Jr... All suitable for the very young.
Adventureland is small, especially with the Indiana Jones ride out of action at the moment, but the Pirates if the Caribbean log flume is definitely a must go on, especially for a photo, and with fast moving queues.
Frontierland is again small but is all about Big Thunder Mountain, and for us the best ride in the park. Fabulous fast adrenaline. Phantom Manor is ok, a ghost style ride, but if you are going to queue then it has to be for BTM!
My favourite section was definitely Discoveryland which has 3 incredible fast pass rides - The incredibly intense Star Wars Hyperspace Mountain, a rollercoaster in the dark. The fabulous Star Tours which is a simulator and has 3 different permutations - so go on it 3 times! And then the fabulous Buzz Lightyear Laser Blast which is suitable for all the family, and endless fun. And surprisingly addictive as you want to go back to keep improving your score! We loved this zone in the park, and surprisingly not as busy as Fantasyland.
This was my first experience of Disney, and we absolutely loved it. Just be prepared for long days, and queues, but plan what’s important to you and enjoy!"
The rides were great,"We were sharp at the gate at 10:00 hours when they open up but was standing behind a million people maybe. Soon after we entered the park people started rushing towards the rides. It's magical truly, but with so many visitors, the magical part becomes pretty messy. There were separate queues for the disabled, but what for the pregnant? A young pregnant lady kept standing in front of us with two of her kids for an hour maybe. The rides were wonderful though. The Pirates of the Carribean, the Indiana Jones and the temple of doom ride and the mountain ride were the best although there were queues of 1-2 hours for each ride."
Some improvements,Came for second visit after first one in May (to make the most of the annual pass). There seems to be a noticeable improvement in the attitude of staff who seemed much friendlier than before. Also fewer smokers. However the queues were still horrendous and some rides were still shut months later eg the train and a autopia and space mountain was closed most of the week. The food was shocking quality and very overpriced.
Lovely 4 days,"Been to Disneyland Paris 3 x times and have enjoyed every time. Went in the Feb half term and the park was quite busy. Therefore we purchased extra fast passes which was about £25 per person. These can be used anytime during the day. When visiting Disney Paris you really need to arrive the earliest you can to opening time. We did this and managed to ride about 5 rides in the first hour of the parks opening. Again like all Disney Parks it’s expensive here, so be prepared."
Not worth it,"We came here during half term break expecting queues and high prices but was unimpressed with the scale of the queues (1 -2 hours on some rides), extortionate pricing, poor food options and number of rides that are closed. To avoid the queues one day i spent €360 for 4 people on an ultimate fastpass which gets you through the queues quickly on those rides where you can use it otherwise we'd have ended up never doing the rides we wanted or any quantity of rides to make our visit worthwhile. But on the day, half the rides where it should have been valid (as mentioned by others here) were closed, making it a complete rip off.
Food is generally fast food and low quality.
Yes the rides were well run and organised, but would you queue with young children for 1 - 2 hours for a 3-4minute ride?"
RIP off Disney,"Just visited Disneyland.2 main rides not working,queues beyond belief for rides,characters,even toilets.visited years Ago with happy memories,now feel ripped off,dissapointed in what can be fitted in ,in the time you are there.Most staff don’t care,prices have gone mad.My daughter is Vegan and lived on bags of nuts,get real and provide for today’s customers.more and more shops but less happy memories.such a shame."
Please do not waste your hard earned money here!!,"Usually not one to complain but today me and a friend visited Disneyland Paris and it was an absolute abomination. 5 of the main rides were shut which lead to the other rides having waiting times of over 2 hours. We paid £73 for our tickets from attractiontix which is cheaper than the €90 you would pay on the day and I am shocked at how little you get for your money. There was no “Disney magic” but a lot of miserable staff walking around, the place was run down and looked tired - when we tried to complain at the end of the day we were told to join a queue (there were around 100 people already in the queue). Please please please do not waste your hard earned money on this place!!
The people I feel for the most are families who save up to come on a special holiday here and this is what they end up with. Really sad and shouldn’t be allowed to continue to charge the prices they do when you could have a much better day good for much less."
"Terrible, too busy, long waits","You expect to queue at Disney but this has got ridiculous. We have been before and spent normally over 60 minutes to do anything. That was also in terrible weather. We were thinking of coming back for a birthday but will definitely not now.
AVOID"
Disney not at its best,"Shame that when French and English half terms coincide many of the Disneyland attractions are closed, including hyperspace mountain, generating huge queues on the rides that are open.
Trying their best with the parades but papering over the cracks big style. Even the riverboat is up the proverbial creek."
"Wonderful place, just poorly operated","Disneyland Paris needs to upgrade its queue time technology, fast pass system and general management of operations. This really affects the efficiency of rides and what people can do at the park.
When busy, this place is tough going - queues build up and don't drop due to the slowness of staff to unload/reload rides.
Informal eateries are terribly slow, and there's not much value to be had when buying snacks or food.
All-in-all it just isn't as good as what you experience in Florida.
But - it is still a great place for families to have fun and see & do lots."
Rides are closed,Be careful what time of year you go. Several rides are closed for refurbishment whilst Space Mountain has been closed now for 3 days because its.... 'broken' Sorry but why doesnt Disney close for a couple of weeks say January to do this refurbishment work.It puts even more pressure on the long queues. Effectively we are getting less value for our money but they don't care because we're all just cash cows.
RUDE Staff!,"Extremely disappointing visit with my disabled daughter!
Abrupt staff with poor English.
Captain Hook actually refused to have a photo with my daughter, we waited our tune in the queue and when it was her turn he turned to the smaller children behind us. We waited again and I took my daughter forward again, he turned his back!
I complained to the three staff members that were close by and they just shrugged and did absolutely nothing.
Love Disney but it is ruined by the French rudeness!
Fourth time we have returned and it was same old. Will save up for Florida as this is not a representation of the true Disney magic!
Despite the wonder fairytale look of the park it is spoilt by ignorance!"
Very nice,"We had wonderful time, it’s really excellent place to visit with your family a lot of fun, action everything is very good, my kids were very happy with the park. At the evening the great show. It’s great place to be visited"
Second Visit,"Visited for a second time and a day longer than before. The park and rides are amazing and deserve five stars. However, overall the experience is too expensive, too much time spent queuing for rides even with fast pass tickets. Food prices in the park are horrendous. The park staff are mostly friendly and helpful but the staff in the shops are the exact opposite. They are rude, disinterested in offering any service and make it abundantly clear that it is an inconvenience to them to have to look for anything in the stock room. Their standard reply is no they don’t have it despite being told the entire range was on display the day before. Customer service training definitely required here. Enjoy the park and the rides, take a picnic with you and be prepared for poor service in the shops."
Picture Perfect,What a beautiful place to celebrate my daughter sweet 16! We have been to Disney in Florida and California and this is our favorite so far. The castle was definitely larger and nicer.. and so we the fireworks. Please keep in mind we visited all three parks within one year . Found that the decor throughout this park was a lot nicer than their counterparts in the US. Also having gone to Disney at Halloween numerous times in the US found the decorations in Paris a lot nicer as well. Also noticed a lot of small differences between similar attractions at this park than the others as far as the layout and the length of the actual attraction. there were definitely some differences. There were less attractions at this park. But the price was also less at this park then the US Disney parks. Loved that this park was accessible to public transportation. 10 minute train ride from airport!! Train literally drops you at front gate of park!!
Amazing place,"We often goes here with my family. Children like Disney most of all, that is favorite place. Especially they like the parade of Disney characters. If go there you will definitely get lots of positive emotions. Recommend."
Happiness,Make sure to drop into Disneyland whilst in Paris. Grab the double park pass and get there early! Plenty of activities and rides even for big kids like myself and my hubby.
Amazing,"This was my first to europe and i visited disneyland park paris and walt disney studio

Terror of tower
Crush coaster(not for weak heart peoples) very long que
If u are smoker
Have smoking area inside"
Parades and characters the highlights,"We visited with our 2 year old, who absolutely loved the character parades and meet and greets. The parades are Disney at its best and the best way to see all the characters. The lines for meet and greets are long as there's a sneaky app called LineBerty you can use to queue jump which is a bit secretive and sells out fast. The majority of the food is low quality, fast food and it is hard to eat healthy so try and plan this ahead. Worth getting meal deals and photo passes if you can. Disappointed that modern Disney like Frozen, Moana etc is shelved in favour of now very dated Pinocchio, Pan etc. Evening light show on the castle is superb."
Our worst Disney experience,The park is beautiful in its design and landscaping. However it is a small park in comparison to others. The issue my wife and I had was with a guest relations employee ( male of non French ancestry) who was not professional in his customer service abilities and not friendly towards Americans. We had employee e-tickets and had to go through customer service to get tickets as they would not work the way they were supposed too as they did for us in Shanghai China Disneyland. The male employee was disrespectful and hateful in his demeanor. He would not adequately answer my questions or take my phone to download the tickets to print or help me through the process. Yet we watched as he took the phone from the person behind me. I finally found a helpful and sincere female employee who cleared everything up and gave us the service you come to know from Disney. This female employee actually worked at Disney World before Disneyland Paris and was a credit to all that Disney is. We met another American couple in the park who told us they had been experiencing prejudice towards them with some employees of establishments around Paris when they figured out they were Americans. This issue with the employee cost us over an hour of precious time
Disney fun a la Paris!,"You know you're in Disney as it has the same feel, but is smaller than other parks and more cozy. We actually liked the feel. Some unique attractions and experiences that we want to experience again."
No coffee,Why is there nowhere to get a cup of coffee or tea on the park when you arrive early? Have spent over thirty minutes to find somewhere that is open or where hot drinks are served.
Average,"This is a place where you go to buy. It was built for this particular purpose. Nothing fancy about it. Worsestill, you might starve as by 5 pm you might suddenly find that all restaurants are fully booked and if you have kids, it is better to bring some sandwiches just to stay waiting for the closure which is the main event. This closure starts at 11 pm and last train where thousands of people are going to use leaves at midnight. So you have to run or not enjoying the full show. Why at this late time, I have nooooooooo Idea.
Moreover. your kids whether using the ordinary pass or the fast past won't enjoy more than 2-3 games.
One of the confusing things about this tourist attraction is that we saw Winnie the Pooh and since my kids love him, we wanted to take photo with him but Alas, For a strange reason, Disney decided that only one employee wear the Pooh costume and people have to book early to take photo with him. Comeon, you need to bring someone else to do the same instead of depriving kids coming overseas from taking this photo. The rest of characters like the Great Mickey is also the same. We were able to take a photo with the Arthur Sward and the Beans Giant Tree. Thanks God they don't move or need actor or actress with them because Disney might not be able to afford that."
Wonderful experience,"I am Disney fan and take every opportunity to visit their theme parks and I went to Disneyland Paris on the last day of my vacation and I was very pleased with the attractions shorter lines, food inside the theme parks were really good so I would definitely come back on my next Paris visit."
Magical,"We visited here early October. This place is fab with lots to see and do. A very busy place, but queuing wasn't too bad as we went when children were still at school. We stayed in the Sequoia Lodge Hotel, which we were also impressed with. Just take plenty of spending money, food and drink is not cheap. And there are endless Disney and Souvenir shops!"
Way to busy,"Had two days here in October. Must say very very disappointed.
Spent most of the days queuing to get my 3 yr old daughter on rides. Did 3 rides per day so this works out to be very very expensive.
The park was very busy and I believe Disney should put a cap on the amount of people allowed in per day.
To top it all off everything else inside was very expensive too. BEar in mind my wife and I paid over £200 to get in per day then had to pay 25€ to hire a pushchair. Disgraceful. Food is poor quality and again very expensive.
Disney is a greedy company if you ask me"
Back again,"It’s had to resist coming back here because the memories you make here are as special as this place is
This time was our last time to visit the studio park before the marvel land opens
Rock n roller coaster was great fun & glad i had the chance to ride it again
Am sure ironman retheme be great"
Best time ever !,"This was our second Disney visit after Hong Kong. It was just great, my eight year old son kept going till he was really tried by the end of the day. The rides are good. The parade is awesome. We saw few shows on the occasion of Halloween."
Best time ever.,We visited for my sons 5th birthday and he had the best time. Every cast member we came across were lovely and all wished him a happy birthday. We had 2 days of really bad rain but this didn’t spoil things. We went Monday-thurs and glad it wasn’t a weekend as come Thursday the park was rammed. Parades amazing. We got drinks and snacks from train station before we went into park as drinks etc are ridiculous expensive. We will return in a few years when the avengers hotel and rides are all set up.
Magical weekend despite the rain,"The Parc was beautifully decorated with a Halloween theme. You need to be prepared for long waiting lines and high prices, but it is a magical experience. Glad to have been once. I especially liked the show with the villains."
Amazing trip for grown-ups too!,"Just got back from 3 days at Disneyland paris. Having been before i knew the layout of the park relatively well. I do have a few tips to help minimize your queuing time, as with any disney park (or even theme park) make sure you are prepared and take advantage of fast pass. You really do get sucked into the disney magic while there, especially on a quieter day.
It was Halloween season, and the park was decorated beautifully. We had an amazing time, went on big thunder 5 or 6 times and space mountain 4 or 5 times. PoTC and PM had short queues. Buzz had a short queue at the start of the day, we tried to shoot the badge in the middle of Zurg's chest to win the maximum points but no luck.
We really enjoyed the new Halloween show with Ursula, although i wish more villains were out for meet and greets, only maleficent and the non-face characters like queen of hearts and Jafar were meeting people.
The negatives were mainly around other guests. These included: a man filming the parade in front of my face and knocking my ears off in the process, he ran off in embarrassment, people pushing to get in front of you if you left 2cm of a gap, 12 year old girls screaming at full volume throughout a ride, and people expecting you to let them and their children push in front to see the parade/shows- i witness a woman be asked by a family if she could move and let them all go in front and she said no, they still kept trying to push past regardless, you really have to stand your ground lol.
Another gripe which is mainly people writing reviews is that some people feel that children are more entitled to have fun than adults. We all paid our money to come, we all are entitled to meet characters or go on slower rides like snow white or its a small world. We can all have fun, grown ups and kids alike. Reading reviews where people are called 'freaks' for wanting to do so is quite disgusting and they need to give their heads a wobble. Anyway, back on to my advice for getting the most out of your day.
TIPS
- Fastpass is your friend! Big thunder mountain had a 60 minute queue, but the fast past allowed us to come back an hour later and queue for 10 mins or less. You get a 30 minute slot, and its free for everyone, just scan your ticket.
- Staying in a disney hotel gets you access to Extra Magic Hours.You can enter the parks from 8am, with rides opening at 8.30. If nothing else i'd recommend getting in before 10 as thats when the general public arrive and the park gets much busier.
-Depending on the time of year, you should pick your position for the parade and illuminations half an hour before. If its peak time then an hour or more could be necessary. I stood at the rope just behind the disabled area on the left hand side near the castle, and i got the best views there. Other options include in front of flower beds. Note that people often put kids on their shouders which can make the place you've waited so long for not so great, so choose wisely. For the parade, the row of shops by main street is the busiest. Note that for the parade and illuminations you'll likely get kids trying to push past your legs to get in front, adults doing the same, people using your shoulder as a tripod to film, someone holding their phone in front of your face to film, etc. Just enjoy the moment guys, its on youtube if you want to watch it back...
- dress up or disneybound! Dress your kids up for the best interaction, and do disneybounding as an adult if you can. If not, then wearing a themed t shirt or ears at least will get you noticed by the characters and makes them smile! I was bounding as Rapunzel and i got amazing interaction in the parade, including the lost boys making fun of being a princess making a queen like wave haha and Gaston winked at me at the villains show.
-Book restaurants in advance, places got very busy and at table service restaurants its unlikely you'll get a table turning up. This is especially for auberge de cendrillon, captain jack's, plaza gardens, inventions etc. You can book online now too.
- Auberge de cendrillon is your best bet to meet princesses! To avoid the 1 hour or more wait, book a breakfast or lunch there.
-Download lineberty and be ready at 9.45 to book meet and greet slots! They usually go in 10 minutes.
-Bring snacks!
-check the crowd calendar before you book, to see how busy it'll be. This is available online."
Awesome place.,Try to visit in Summers or on a sunny day. crowded so reach early. stay at nearest hotels. explore all rides.
excellent stay,kids had a fantastic time even when it rains the magic stays. Second time we have been and it never disappoints
Fantabulous place for every age!!,"Me and my wife visited this place during winters, which is the best time to avail all rides and also finish both the parks without any long queues, only drawback was that it was tooooo cold. The closing show (fireworks and projection) was jaw dropping!!"
Special trip,"A very special place to visit with family and friends. It’s a wonderful way to create memories for the younger family members, something they will never forget. It’s not cheap and I’ve No complaints, except a lot of the rides were unavailable during the visit. We queued for 40 mins for one ride only for it to breakdown and close, and very little information passed to the public.
All in we had a great time and will come back again in the future."
It's a magical place.,"So we stayed at the Disney hotel and got a package with half board. This means you get each day entry even if you can't check into your room , you can go into Disney. It gives you free parking, early entry one lunch and one dinner in Disney, now make sure you book most places get full quick. The place was great, you just feel like a big kid walking in. Things are not cheep when you look at the price and convert it to you own money (Australian) but don't think about it, just do it. (Think.if you got to Queensland it works out about the same.) There are heaps of ride and shows plenty of characters walking around. Things for all ages. Loved it and will.go back."
Wonderful time but has it's downsides,"Me and my partner visited in early October and when we got there, found out all the Halloween decorations were up and this was fantastic. Great addition to the park, makes it that little bit more special.
Unfortunately while we were there, the Indiana Jones ride, Peter Pan ride and Alice's Maze where all closed. Pinocchio, Buzz Lightyear, and It's a small world ride all broke down whilst we were on it. I asked an Employee where the Aerosmith ride was as I went on it about 16 years ago and loved it. And he didn't know what I was talking about. This is still advertised but it isn't here.
The park opens and hour and a half early for people staying in the park but you can only go to the middle part, rest of the park and kiosks are closed off, so what's the point?
Tried to eat at an Italian as were sick of burgers and fries, went to a restaurant near Frontier land marked J on the map, CLOSED. Tried the one by Aladdins caves, CLOSED. None has any reason as to why.
I had a letter before I came to the park saying ""Some attractions are being refurbished"" but how extensive is this list.
Other than the rides that works, Disney Illuminations and some of the themes, the rest of the park was pretty mediocre and not worth the money paid however we made the best and had a good time none the less.
Make sure you have lots of spending money, not just for merchandise but for food as a meal will not come to less than 50 euros for 2."
My Favourite Place,"I just love it!
We (6 adults & 2 Children) spent 4 days across the 2 parks and it’s just brilliant.
The theming everywhere is fantastic, there is something for everyone, thrill rides, character meets, walk throughs.
I love the parades, the attention to detail, the fact that most things are suitable for everyone.
Yes, you’ll have to queue, yes it’s busy, yes it’s expensive but it’s Disneyland (also you can’t blame Disney for other people).
Tips
-if you want to meet a princess but not queue for 2 hours, you need to be in the park, at the entrance to fantasyland at half 8 and be prepared to run (not a joke) or book a lunch/breakfast.
- Baby switch is great - it meant the other child could ride with each parent (essentially getting 2 rides)
- make the most of the meet & greets - the character interaction is brilliant
- make the most of fastpass
- don’t miss the dragon under the castle or the scull rock walk through
- don’t miss the parade or illuminations
- if it’s busy use the arcades either side of Main Street to enter or exit
- relax and enjoy it, you probably won’t get everything done but at the end you won’t worry about what you missed because of everything you did do."
Love love LOVE!!,"Have been to Disneyland Paris every year since 2016. Went at different times of the year to see the different theming. It's just so magical! Main street USA smells divine, and I know the smell is pumped into the street. Love all of the shops and variety of them. Plenty of food choices dotted around the park for counter service, buffets, etc. Meet and greets are easy to get to, and it's always helpful to pic up a map on the way in. Always spend the majority of our holidays in this park instead of the studios as there's more to do. Also love that there's a Christmas shop in the park all year round"
Disney Magic,"We decided to go here because we managed to get the tickets at half priced ! So why not make a trip to the happiest place on earth! It’s easy to get there using the train from Paris. Beautiful day at Disney but sadly many rides were closed hence we finished the day pretty quick . Which is why I think it was half priced. Nevertheless, nothing beats the Disney Magic and feeling like a kid again. We still had a great time!"
Amazing From Start to Finish,"What an amazing day we had. We have a 9 year old son in a wheelchair & from the minute we drove in parking, to getting our carers ticket was so easy. I have nothing but praise for how well the park is run & how inclusive it is. As a family of 5 we were able to access every ride except 1 with our disable child. Thank you Euro Disney for creating the most amazing & magical memories for us we will be for ever grateful."
Magical!,"While staying in Paris we booked a day ticket to both Disney Land and Warner Brothers Studios.
Both parks are amazing and there wasn't any kids in our group so we stuck to the big thrill rides. We started in the Warner Bros Studios going on The Tower Of Terror which was by far one of the best attractions, we then went on the studio tour ride, RC Racer, Ratatouille Ride and watched the Motor Action Show.
We had lunch in one of the Warner Bros Diners which was awful, all I can say is rubbish food at extremely high prices. The Gluten Free options are horrendous as they have covered themselves by taking every allergen out of the dish, leaving just mush on a plate.
We ventured on to Disney Land where we went on both Star Wars rides, big thunder mountain and the Pirates Of The Caribbean ride.
Before the firework display at the end of the night we risked going to another restaurant, this was the all you can eat buffet and was worth the wait in the queue as it was good food with plenty of options (including Gluten Free)
We got some memorabilia from the gift shops and then watched the fire work display at the main castle which was spectacular!
Overall an incredible day, enjoyed by everyone. Queues can get long so plan your day to get on as many rides as you can and avoid the fast food style diners. You need more than one day to see everything in both parks and if travelling by train, get your tickets home at the start of the day as it is chaos with everyone leaving at the same time at the end of the night."
Great for families,Loving our time here but not 100% for thrill seekers - there are some great rides but the majority are catered towards younger guests.
A Joyful Place on Earth,"Disney knows how to draw a smile on people's faces. Paris Disneyland is a replica of other Disney lands. It has 2 Parks, hotels, restaurants, cafes and shops. All with the Magical touch of Disney. Everybody is happy adults more than minors. It's a charming world."
a lot of fun!,i love it i spent whole day in Disneyland and it was the best time of my life! this place have different magic and atmosphere but i really liked it coming back as soon as it’s possible
So so disappointing,"What happened to the magic of Disneyland? Every single employee that we encountered was absolutely miserable - I didn’t expect “American” enthusiasm but everyone is just so glum, so slow and so unhelpful. Not a smile, welcome or anyone willing to help. We arrived into Charles de Gaulle airport and we approached a lady wearing a costume who was holding a sign for the magic Disney bus. We enquired with her about how much tickets were and I don’t think we have ever encountered a more miserable person. Subsequently we decided to just get a taxi as the bus was 26€ each. On arrival we didn’t have a clue where to store our luggage (no signs) so we enquired at the “help desk” where the man practically snapped at my sister that baggage hold was in side the park. We asked one staff member for a picture of our group of 5 in front of the castle and again also miserable. There were no characters floating around. We had fast pass tickets but one of the 6 fast pass rides in the main park was closed. If you don’t have kids and are going for a thrill I would do the 2 parks in one day and get in early- make sure you buy the fast pass or just go to Thorpe park. Or just hold off on going to Paris and save your money for Disney and universal in Florida. The train going around the park was also closed. All in all a group of miserable slow moving staff, mad q’s on a weekday at off peak times and just not enough rides open to fill a day."
As expected.... Magical,"Although quite same as other Disney parks, this one surprised me as it's very spacious and you don't feel the crowds too much."
Amazing experience,"Just got back from a 4 day visit staying at a Disney hotel with my parents and 9 year old son. We all had a blast and the best time. The park is super clean and so much attention to detail. The park wasn’t too busy (late September early October) so we really didn’t have to queue much at all. The parades were so much fun. I read an earlier review which noted it didn’t suit the reviewers 9 year old ... well my 9 year old loved it. He collected autographs as he went round and loved meeting the characters. He will remember this for years. The only cons I would note are:
- food service is so slow so be prepared. Walt Disney studios has better options especially with the euro food stalls or go to Disney village instead. There is a Starbucks and McDonald’s. Better value for money.
- there were quite a few rides shut which was a shame.
All in all just a great time. Absolutely amazing!"
Amazing experience,"One of our favourite places in the world to visit.
We stayed for Christmas and the whole thing was magical. The staff are simply amazing.
There’s tons to do for all ages as you’d expect.
We stayed offsite at a nearby hotel which was perfectly fine and easy to do.
The fireworks shows are simply amazing and a must see attraction."
Paris Rules,This is an amazing park definitely paradise for kids and the shops are amazing. Bring alot of money though as they really are not nice with their prices.
"It’s Disneyland Paris, not California or Orlando!","We have just arrived back from a day at Disneyland Paris. We are from Australia, and have been to both California and Orlando Disney’s, as well as Hong Kong.
We were excited to come to Disneyland Paris, and as I had utilized the App I knew that there were many rides closed. This is a pity, but I guess that’s what happens in low season.
We caught the RER straight to Disney- had to walk about 100m to get to Disney’s front gate. Security checks you first, and you are able to bring in food, and the people in front of us brought in a small butter knife.
Opening time was 10am, but we were near the front of the queue at 9. Apart from the hotel guests pushing through the line to get to the “magic morning” entry it was very orderly. The best thing was they actually opened the gates at 9:30.
We rushed to the rides we wanted to do, knowing some were closed. Big Thunder mountain was a favorite, as was Star Tours.
First tip- FAST PASS-
Use them, and try to double up on fast passes! What I mean is I could get Star Tours and Buzz Lightyear fastpasses at the same time! They don’t seem to be linked. This is like California Disney in 2011. (California may have changed with magic bands coming in like Orlando) The other thing is that if you are nice you can use your fast pass ANY time after they were valid- we used a 11:50 Star Tours fastpass at 5pm!
Given it was a Monday in low season it did seem “quiet”, it certainly wasn’t like any morning in the US. We didn’t have to wait anything longer the 30 min for any ride, although to see a Princess it was 75min!
Crowds were well behaved, and no queue jumping or theft was seen by myself. Unfortunately nobody cares about smokers- they were everywhere.
There was reasonable areas to sit, and the toilets were clean and convenient.
Staffing seemed a little low, with some rides almost being “self serve” loading. This also showed with the upkeep of the grounds.
We were very keen to do some Pin Trading, and the kids were very disappointed that there almost seemed to be none! This changed later in the afternoon, and by 3pm the kids had been able to do some trading, and I managed to swap for a great Paris pin (I’m not sure if it’s real- it just looks cool) Again, it’s not like the US, where you can trade pins all day, everywhere.
As a family that had done Disney’s we thought we would only do one land- big mistake, in low season, with short queues we could have done both lands- oh well- a rookie mistake for Paris!
The staff were friendly- I think you get what you give. The rides were great and being in French it was a nice difference. Star tours was a little less involved for me as an English speaker with very poor French, but that’s why we came here to Disneyland Paris.
Given all that, we had a great time, but I dont think we would be making a special trip here again. My kids and I love Disney, but I think California is still our favorite. This one is worth the experience."
ok but not great,"let start with the problems first day on park rides not working whole park was down no one to tell you anything they have speakers blasting out music why could they not put any anoucement over them . the card machine went down over the park so had a long line to use the cash machine . if you like standing in line for everything from rides food shops toilets i seen a few women use the mens because of such long line this is the place for you . I think that they should stop grown people with out kids going on rides like the tea cups i seen two 40 yr men on them well i was waiting with my grandkids all they did was look at thier phones. for some rides I think they should not allow adults on with out children .
The shows are good and the fireworks are very good and if you go into the disney village more resturantants to choose from but you want to find one before 5pm or you will be standing in line agaiin as they fill up fast .
would I go back very soon or even next year the answer is no better places to go for more value ."
Wow DaY :),"Wow what a wonderful experience. Only Disney can make something so magical and big working so well. You are prepared for queue so that works fine. It goes relatively quickly but recommends the ""fast pass"" which you only get arranged after entering the park. The whole family of 5 had a wonderful day.The highlight was the amazing light show with fireworks in the evening, for an experience. Be there early because there will be a lot of people. The other parades are also clearly some of the highlights. This became a memory of life for all ages."
4 day break,The shows and parades are so magical it’s lovely to see the children faces think they could have more small children rides as to many adults going on the rides and it’s to long to que for small children so should only be children with a adult to many ques everywhere in the rides shops food places the golden nugget restaurant was lovely with a free show grandchildren loved it the parks are very clean Main Street is lovely lots of walking can’t fault them for sorting stuff out first day family passes didn’t work and nothing was working as it had gone down so the morning u couldn’t go on any rides but sorted free day pass out for any day to use at both parks
I want to go back.,Went there on my birthday and absolutely loved every second. Its massive and walking around feels like you just stepped into a fairytale. Long queues unless you have a fast pass. I definitely going back.
They don’t make much effort,"Here today , too many rides not functioning
Lack of cast members to give directions.
Payment desks in shops and eating places unable to process card payments!!!!
I love it here and I didn’t let it spoil my day but may have been a different outcome had I not brought enough cash for food."
Lots of fun,"We had a 2 night break here staying in Hotel Cheyenne. The first afternoon was good on the rides and the accommodation was great.
However, we ended up hungry and tired, when the only place we could find open was a Tex Mex restaurant, Fuente del Oro. The queuing was a nightmare, the service was very slow and the food was ok, not brilliant.
On the next morning, although we were up early, the queue for breakfast was nightmarishly long and not a great experience.
However (using this word again), we started to make sense of the systems...
What we learnt:
If you have the early access pass for the parks, use these before going for breakfast and then come back to the hotel for breakfast. The queues for the rides were minimal (Crush’s Coaster - no queue!) and the breakfast was much more enjoyable and relaxing. You can then go out again to the rides.
Make sure you use your fast pass to get allocated rides times.
Use the Disneyland app to tell you queue times so you can decide what to go on (Hyperspace mountain for an unknown reason often had really short queues and was excellent).
We had a really wonderful time...using the whole day to maximise the fun.
Our 10 year old daughter loved it and we would go again."
Excellent,First time visiting and really loved both disneyland paris parks. We visited in high season however it was easy to navigate around & que times were not awful. Really useful free fast-passes Available for most rides and we used these to our full advantage and did this park in a day. Castle is beautiful would recommend watching the parade. Returned evening time for the fireworks and it really is amazing! Recommend anyone to attend. Will be returning.
Average,
Good but nothing changes,"I love Epcot but its hard to engage the younger audience . It hasn't changed a lot over the years and the fireworks compared to 20,15,10 years ago are mediocre .Like all the Disney parks you pay entry to access over priced gift shops and over priced eating outlets ."
"Continues to be a fav, but lots of construction this time","There are so many things we love about Epcot, Spaceship Earth, the land, Soar'n, Food and Wine Festival (which was going on while we were there). There were not only the regular countries which were represented but food stands from almost every region of the world ... great time."
Disappointed at the rides breaking down,We were staying on Disney property for 5 days. We traveled at this time because Disney information said it was a green or slower time. The amount of people were so great you could hardly walk through the park. The rides were constantly breaking down and the fast pass is very frustrating process
Still cool even while under construction,Even though I visited while this park is going through a lot of construction I still enjoyed it as always. I am looking forward to all the new rides and attractions coming in the future. To me one of the most underrated restaurants is here as well. The Corral Reef is incredible and I will eat there on every visit.
Family vacation,My fiancé loved this one as she liked the cultural side of it. My daughter got to meet a lot of the main old school disney characters as well which was nice. She loved the Nemo ride. Epcot has improved to be a bit more kid friendly with the Frozen ride but still needs more
Like post war Berlin in the rain.,"Really hard to see how EPCOT is part of the Disney World experience. Should have been bulldozed years ago, but is undergoing a slow renovation. Rides are dated and in complete contrast to Animal and Hollywood. No-where to get a coffee and sit indoors today when it was 50' and raining. French bakery full.. Seasons was empty but horrible. Thank heaven we have other things to do."
Family visit,"I didn’t know what to expect of this attraction as I’d heard a mixture of reports. It’s a place of two halves, one where the educational rides are and the other a display of various countries of the world. The first area is really interesting as you can design and test drive a car, go on a simulated voyage to the moon or Mars or do other stimulating activities. The second is nothing but a tacky shopping tour of items from around the world. These items are over priced and poorly made. I’m sure this side of Epcot was fine when world wide travel was out of most people’s financial budget but it is now dated and not really necessary."
Disappointing day,"We visited the park in mid October, it’s the place we usually like to go for a relaxing day but we left after only a couple of hours and didn’t go back.
First problem is the construction work going on which effects transportation, the entrance and a large percentage of the park.
I understand why the construction work needs to be done but if they going to close so much of the park at once they really should adjust the cost of entry to compensate guests.
The second problem was the Food Festival, compared to our last visit in 2012 this has become a bit of a monster which draws very big crowds, we struggled to sample any of the food due to queues.
There’s also lots of alcohol on sale in the festival and we saw a few rowdy drunken groups, if I wanted to see that I’d have gone to Blackpool for two weeks and save myself a lot of money."
Candlelight Processional Celebrating Christmas,"Disney really does Christmas well, but we think this celebration, is the best. A full symphony orchestra, a living Christmas tree, & 400+ Choir members singing Christmas Hymns, with the Christmas story narrated by Gary Sinese makes it very special. The choirs come in (process) from behind you, all carrying a candle, then the narrator reads Matthew's story of the First Christmas, when Christ
humbled himself to be born of a
woman to come into the world to
save us all. It is beyond moving to
hear the story, with the ending with
the Hallelujah Chorus from Messah.
Brings tears to our eyes every time.
Can't recommend highly enough."
Looking it’s age,Surprised by how busy the park was even in an off time ( after Thanksgiving but before Christmas rush). Last visited about 5 years ago and alcohol was available in restaurants in the countries but now it is even on the street in kiosks. Disney might have gone too far with this given lots of strollers and adult scooters; not easy place to walk. Disappointed very little holiday decorations in the park and the amount of construction. Epcot is definitely looking old and warn.
The front of the area by Space Ship earth is a mess with contruction walls everywhere.,Granted that once this is done the look will be much improved. They are also tearing down one of the communicore buildings to the right of Space Ship earth ball. Best to focus on the counries and enter through the international gate there to avoid this mess.
EPCOT should be discounted given current construction levels.,"I love EPCOT. I have fond memories of it as a child, and have really enjoyed previous visits with our family. Here's the thing, EPCOT is undergoing massive construction, and it's only getting worse.
I appreciate the parks have to be updated, and I am hopeful that once EPCOT emerges from this transformation it will be better than ever. World Showcase is looking good, and seems to be largely unscathed, but Future World (i.e. the area toward the front of the park) is a mess.
There are construction walls everywhere. Braving the crowds in the sea of green construction walls is undeniably not a fun experience. Disney charges premium prices for premium experiences. This is not a premium experience.
When a park is unarguably a mess like EPCOT is now, Disney should not be selling it at full price."
Great Day,"Had a great time with my 13 yo. The place just makes you want to jump on a plane to any and everywhere. We were so tired, we had to leave before the fireworks. Favorite Disney Park."
Love Epcot,My wife and myself visited here with family and we loved it. The rides are great especially Sorin and Test Track but my favourite is Around the World it is so nice just wandering around all the different countries trying different food and drinks. I would definitely recommend a day or 2 here.
Wonderful Festival of the Holidays show,"We stood in line for three hours in the standby line as all the dinner and show tickets were sold out about two months in advance of the show. Gary Sinese was the moderator, and the 2019 Epcot international Festival of the Holidays Candlelight Processional show was amazing. I highly recommend the program!"
In need of the refresh its now getting,"It's taken a long while but this Park is now getting a revamp that it desperately needs.
There are still the good old standbys of Soaring and Test Track but to a great extent it is the ""special events"" that give life to the Park.
Lots of construction disrupting the flow of the Park hints of an exciting future..."
My favourite Disney park,"By far my favourite Disney park. The theming, once again, is awesome. There are two lands, one is a general section of attraction, and the second part is a world showcase where you walk through different countries. I would have like to have seen more shows/attractions around the countries as a minor complaint. But in all regards it's a lovely place."
Not as fun as it used to be,This park shows it’s age. It’s very expensive and the attractions have been closed and opened for remodeling. The Garden Grill was by far the best food I’ve had in Disney this year. I found this park dirty. You definitely need a full day to see all of it. Maybe 2.
Still think Epcot is the best park for adults with no children,"Our last review of Epcot was years ago so we wanted to update our rating now that are boys are both teens and not so little anymore.
The World Showcase is an amazing way to feel like you are immersed in different parts of the world. Besides the scenery, you can try out different cultural foods and drinks inside each country and sample from ""around the world."" It's especially nice if you are able to go when the outdoor kitchens are set up. We talked about trying a drink from each region; however, this would have been extremely expensive. For the drinks we did try, they were served in small sample cups and were fun to experiment with. Food is the same way with small samples (so you can taste a few different dishes) and was also somewhat pricey for what you get. We figured that is to be expected at Disney, so plan ahead for the extra $s if this is something you want to try.
Soarin is our favorite ride/attraction - you feel like you are parasailing over different famous areas of the world. Test track was a favorite for our teen boys. The boys wandered off on their own for a bit while we spent most of our time at the World Showcase, so I can't really comment on too many of the other rides, but I didn't feel there were as many choices for little kids here compared to the other parks.
We also were able to enjoy an outdoor concert with Garden Rocks and the evening show before heading out for the night. We really enjoyed ourselves but would still recommend the other parks over this one for families with littles. For teens and adults, this is another amazing Disney stop."
Had fun but confused why this happened....,The parks were fun but there was a dolphin at Epcot at the finding Nemo attraction. He was in a cement hole in the ground with some windows in it. The baby was swimming anxiously in circles. There was nothing but water and a big metal pipe in the space he was kept. My husband and I left and went to two other parks after we saw the baby. We returned to Epcot that night about 4-5 hours later and the same dolphin was still there swimming in circles. It’s embarrassing that they do this...
A BEAUTIFUL Tribute to the World!,"This is a MUST-SEE Theme Park at Disney World! It is VERY EXPENSIVE at $112 per person plus tax with NO DISCOUNT for SENIORS, but well worth the price. Eleven countries are presented with their own PAVILIONS and all are AMAZING!"
Impressive,"To me, one of the best disney park in orlando area. You don’t go for the attraction But for all the village. All country selected have their own ambiance and you really enjoy visit them. Drink and eat specific to the village. Buy items you couldn’t find elsewhere"
Bad staff attitude,Visited Epcot last Saturday for the evening fireworks. As there is a lot of construction work going on we were directed out a different route to what we used on entering the park. We asked a cast member to direct us to the medical overflow car parking and you would think we had asked her to fly to the moon and back. Her attitude was appalling and she just tutted at us as if we were were a nuisance. We found that a lot of cast members at Epcot were not as friendly or helpful as they have been in the past
Under construction,Still a good park. More walking around seeing the countries and decorations. Best Ice cream is in France. We were not there for a long time but we always enjoy Epcot. Soaring is worth the wait. Test Track is a good ride also. Restraunt in The Land area is always good.
Don't go !!,It's like going to a 1980s strip mall surrounded by dirty water and old restaurants. I have not been here since just after it opened and it doesn't look like it is changed one bit. Everything is under construction and waiting in line to ride the very few rides at they have is ridiculous. I honestly think they should let everybody in for free and shouldn't charge admission to this place! Awful !! Boring
Under Construction!!,"Just went to EPCOT during the Christmas season and the whole front area of the park is under construction. Ellen's Universe of Energy is being replaced by a mammoth indoor roller coaster based on Guardians of the Galaxy, the center of EPCOT is completely boarded up, including the area in front of Test Track for what is going to be a centerpiece garden area? All the pavilions and other rides are still open, however. Visit the building at the back of Future World to the left as you enter the World Showcase (where the first aid station is) and they have a very cool stand up theater experience that tells about the changes, including upgrades to China and a new Ratatouille ride dehind the shops and restaurants in France. The new fireworks show is great."
"Sadly there is obnoxious, inebriated behavior at this park more than the others","“Disney has taken away my magical experience,” sadly, our 17 year old exclaimed as we were heading into Epcot via the Yacht and Beach Club entrance at 7pm and on our way to dinner...
2 very intoxicated adults were exiting and we saw one knock over a bench, stumble drunk mid way down the path and fall down very hard passing out while the second drunk leaned over her with his spilling beer willing her to stand up. It was tactless. My husbands first thoughts were I’m so glad we don’t have any little people with us. Our 14 year old said, “that’s not a magical experience.” No. Regretfully, this is not even the first that we’ve witnessed in the last year 1/2. I’ve said recently, “don’t go to Disney and especially Epcot after the sun goes down if you don’t want to mingle with stumbling drunks.” So sad. 22 years of magical Disney memories are becoming tainted for us with these experiences...I understand it is ‘hard’ to know when to cut people off especially as many of them ‘drink around the world.’ But as Mary Poppins says, “anything can happen if you let it.”"
Very enjoyable,"A friend and I joined 2 of my daughters, their spouses and 5 children ranging from 5-11 years. It was a long day but we thoroughly enjoyed it. My friend and I are in our 70's but we joined the children on rides and survived - exhausted but laughing. Soarin' and test track won the day"
Marvellous Time,My family and I recently visited this theme park. We had a wonderful time. My 11 year old nephew enjoyed the educational part and off course the rides. Definitely a must to see.
just people trying to sell food and soviners,would not go again pay over $200.00 to have people selling soveriners and food no worth the time or money
Thanksgiving,Really enjoyed Epcot. Christmas dec’s magic. Enjoyed my fish and chips in England quarter. Plenty of characters about to meet and see. Fast pass worked well. Saved much time.
Another fun day!,"My second favorite Disney park, as it is definitely there to cater to adults! The walk ""around the World"", the food, and drinks options are awesome. It does come at a hefty price though, as pretty much everything is grossly overpriced! They also have two awesome rides in Soarin, and Mission Space!"
Disney for Adults.,"Whilst the kids can play around the world by land and sea, the parents can sit back and watch whilst they eat, drink and be entertained from around the world. Do lots of research, there are lots of hidden areas around Epcot. However, If you like lots of surprises, make sure you investigate every nook and cranny."
One day here and its mostly under repair,"Its been a few years since Epcot and the price of admission is not worth it. SO much under repair or closed. As a child I saw the magic of Disney, as an educated adult, I see the cost of Disney. It was a good day but the magic is hard to see. So much is there right in fron t of you if you are looking."
WDW with the grandkids,"Epcot is currently a construction zone and the fast pass policy in use adds to a very poor experience for visitors at the park. You have to choose between soaring, fast track or the frozen ride for the first tier of your 3 fast pass experiences and then fill the other 2 experiences from other limited park rides. This situation will only get worse with the upcoming closure of spaceship earth for a remake in 2020."
A spectacular evening,"I would definitely recommend going to Epcot at Disney World. They have a spectacular firework show in the evening and the environment is extremely friendly and very customer service oriented. I found the staff to be professional, knowledgeable and wonderful to be around. There is a variety of things you can do it Epcot, such as the different international cuisine’s, plus many of the rides of the future."
Epcot,I didn't realize that there was so much in the way of renovations in process. But that did not detract from the visit. Hope to be back when the renovations are complete.
Glad to see things are being updated !,"First, go to the Epcot Experience!
A 360degree theater (in former food court by Test Track) revealing what’s in store for EPCOT. Both futuristic and attractions!
I don’t mind but you should be aware that green walls abound, all around, as renovation is finally starting.
Having a 6yr old, I appreciated the ‘Passport’ available in the World Showcase country pavilions. Each country has table set up where kids can get or present their Passport books. A plastic packet included: passport-like book, cards & stickers. A child had the opportunity to learn and the adults could see the wares on sale. Passport stamp and little drawing were affixed by the country’s representative.
You can clock easily 5-10miles waking around EPCOT, so best to try and plan your Fast Pass routes and eating places ahead of time.
Evening fireworks are temporary as Illumination is being redesigned. The replacement show is weak but it’s something to see to close the evening.
The little used gateway to the Broadwalk Resorts (rear entry of EPCOT by World Showcase, the other side of park away from the Monorail) is no longer sleepy as the terminus for the new Skyliner to Caribbean Beach++ Resorts is there.
Nice day when you finish it with a dinner at one on the country pavilions."
Epcot and Walt Disney World for Families and Grandparents,"Disney is very amazing but the prices are astronomical for our Young Families with kids for hotels, park passes, restaurants and hotels on property. As a Florida Grandparent if you decide to visit with your Family your 1 Day pass is 125.00!! Give me a Break Mr. Eizner!!! To park your Grandparent car at preferred Parking to is 45.00 the other choice is 30.00!!!!!"
Candlelight procession and new fireworks,"Absolute wonderful experience with Neil Patrick Harris narrating, music and singing awesome!
Then greatly underwhelmed by much anticipated new fireworks. Nothing said holiday in the show at all."
As good as always!,"We used to visit there with our children for four times. Now they grew up and we, two visited again after ten years absence.
It was crowded but as good as always! When we visited, International Wine and Food Festival was held. I was excited and bought some food, for example, fried sausage, paella. fried noodle, meat pie, red curry and so on. Every dishes was small and average price was about $7~8. But....they were not so good except red curry(it was beautiful!) Sausage was salty, cold and tough, paella dried, and pie was sticky. It was so sorry.
We visited all pavilions and found that almost all of them were just souvenir shop except Mexico. Before there exhibited history and some unique cultures of each countries.
There was the Land and the Sea the same as before. The tour inside the Land was interesting and the Land had a big food court to enjoy snacks and take a rest. It was good."
Food and Wine was Excellent!,We went to Epcot for the last weekend of the food and wine show. The park was crowded but not overwhelming. The lines for the food were mostly manageable. We loved everything we got. Definitely pace yourself! We will definitely attend again next year.
grate adult fun,Love Epcot. The rides are good (not great) but the country's make up for any lacking. food is average.
Mmmm food,"We were lucky to be at Epcot during part of the Food & Wine Festival. We went on a Tuesday and while it seemed crowded, we never experienced long waits. It was great to go from ‘country to country’ and try mini plates of food and samples of beer/wine. The Lobster rolls in America were great, the coffee infused meat in Africa was delicious and the shrimp w/noodles from Taiwan were a nice bite. There is a ton of walking to be expected, but it wasn’t rushed or noisy. The lakes and views were lovely, we saw several characters there, Mickey, Goofy, Minnie. There are some good rides in Epcot also, and the little film shorts were cute and worth the time and also a nice sit down from all the walking. We loved Epcot!"
Procession of lights.,"Enjoyed the choirs and orchestra. They should have announced where they were from. On another note, the park was overcrowded and seems to be pushing trinkets and food and drink. Hardly for to enjoy the culture from each country. No Japanese traditional outfits or dances. Very disappointed. Other countries did not showcase well. The crowds were crazy. I'm done with disney!"
So excited for future Epcot!,"Parts of Epcot feel a little like a building site.For the first hour or so of our most recent visit in November I felt a little sad seeing cranes, half demolished buildings etc. Then we visited the Epcot Experience and watched the videos of future Epcot. Suddenly the visibility of the building work and cranes became exciting - this is building the amazing future Epcot!
We then visited another 3 times during our two week stay in WDW.
We always love Illuminations: Reflections of Earth at the end of every day. We loved forward to the new permanent end of night show. But and having watched many You Tube vides of Epcot Forever we were genuinely surprised at just how good it is. Incredible fireworks and music. Great show and watched it twice.
Soarin' remains one of our absolute favourite rides and we love a stroll around World Showcase. Last year we also visited the first two weeks of November. This year we were left a little sad that due to the extended run of Food and Wine, the Christmas Tree wasn't put up until after we left."
Amazing experience,"I will not forget those rides I’ve been. Happiness to everyone but I was scared of heights
Love the “ Soaring High “ it was an amazing experience
They have a vast area of “ Food Wine “ loved it so much!!! They have different country theme
and attractions. I will definitely go back there with my family
The fireworks were beautiful and entertaining
I love the boat ride to cross the other side without walking that long. Easy access to go back it was well worth it. The whole environment is clean & tidy especially for my concern to the restrooms.
Thank you very much!!!!"
Epcot,"Having been to Epcot many times, my main observation is that it is currently undergoing many changes. Some aspects remain the same as when it opened. The employees are superb. We were very pleased with our family dinners in France, England, and at Coral Reef. One of the many nice things about Epcot is the better ability to move due to the wider walkways."
A lot of work going on but still great,New rides being built and large public areas closed for a big regeneration project don’t stop this being a great place to come. Love the food and drink options and the really unique attractions. Mouse gears is one of the best Disney shops too!
A little worn out,"We were here 10 years ago and little has changed. It's getting a little bit outdated. There was a lot of construction going on, but no new countries in the World Showcase."
"Fab time, but they have NO time for smokers!!!","The park is really expensive to enter but hey your on holiday. Whilst in you are held to their prices on drinks and food but hey that’s normal. My gripe is their intolerance and lack of facilities for people who smoke! There are no facilities at all, you have to leave the park and beg to be let back in! Most of the vast park is outside and there is not one space made available for smokers surely this is not right, sorry it must be me and my partner who smoke! Anyway won’t be coming back to pay £150 to enter and £10 per country per pint for the privilege until uncle Walt’s men provide areas to smoke!!!!!!!!!!!"
Epic Time,"My husband and I visited Epcot on a spontaneous vacation. We enjoyed walking thru the different countries, but we especially enjoyed China. We had the best ever egg rolls and spicy chicken dish. To make the experience even better I had a delicious lemon beer with tequila. Absolutely loved everything about this place."
Food and Wine has lost all of it's fun,"I've been going to Food and Wine for 8 years now. It was once a place full of amazing food. It just cost quite a bit for each meal, but the quality and experience was always worth it. Some years were better than others. It seemed like the meals got a bit smaller every year.
Now they haven't put out any good food this year. They cut corners to the point where the food is as bland as any cheap restaurant. I wondered why the park seemed so empty this year on a Saturday. I found out why.
Don't even bother. It's about $4 - 8 dollars a tiny plate for low quality. Orlando is full of amazing restaurants. Go around town and enjoy good food around the city instead.
Note to Disney, please stop cutting costs to the point where the food isn't even enjoyable. You kept pushing it. Now it's dead."
Afternoon at Epcot,Got off cruise ship and made a trip to Epcot for the afternoon from hotel. It was my Sweetie first trip here. We went to the countries and ate at China 9 Dragons. It was great. Went and visited several countries them over to Imagination with Figment. We had a great time And will be back again.
EPCOT in Disney World,"It's true, nobody does it like Disney. The futuristic rides are creative and fun. The countries have an authentic feel about them.
But my husband and I had one day to spend at Disney and it cost us $125 each to get tickets to visit this one park. I think that is outrageous for a family park. And buying for more than one day is not much better."
A Dream come true,"We did it all and loved it all
A word of advice if you come in November or December it gets dark early so get moving early so you can see and do more
We carried a LARGE group ( family) 13 people.
We all , ages 8-82 Loved everything
We had so much fun even with the large crowds we felt safe and easy to move . The cast was ALL so friendly and kind everyone worked hard to make it The Happiest Place on Earth!"
Never gets old,"Epcot will always hold a special place in my heart. I'll give the con up front (which is the only one I have) the attractions are on one side of the park and everything else is on the other. Which will change soon actually with the addition of new rides. I love spaceship earth. I love Soarin! I love food and wine. I love reading up on and experiencing other cultures and trying all the new foods. Whether you visit during Food & Wine/Festival of the Holidays etc. you will definitely leave learning something new. I'm sad that things are changing somehwat but I look forward to the revamp which also gives me more reasons to visit in the future! I will say I think Epcot is for the older kids or adults, but with Nemo and other rides I know children will also have a great time here."
Fastpass a waste of time,"We went to Epcot and there were only two areas that you could book rides on the fastpass system, the place is like a giant building site at the moment. Not impressed with the fastpass system ,its a complete waste of money, might as well arrive when the gates open and join the normal queues."
Food and Wine Festival,"My wife and I had a great time celebrating our 23rd anniversary and trying some new food at the added countries and kiosks around the world showcase.
I look forward to returning as often as I can.
Disney offers some specials and incentives to try the different options. You should research ahead of time. I wish we had a little more, but was still happy with our experience."
Great Time,"Epcot used to be my least favorite of the WDW parks, no so anymore. Epcot seems to be the least crowded of all parks in WDW. Great people, great food!"
Travel arround the world - EPCOT,"Visit during food and wine festival. Average price for drinks is about $11 and for food arround the various counties about $12-$14 per plate. Portions are really small though. Best fast food and pastries - France - Their deserts were amazing so were their sandwiches especially their croissants. Reasonable prices as well considering you are in Disney.
Best quick bite: England's fish and chips
Best Beer; Irish Pub. Guiness is imported from Ireland and it has a really unique taste. Worth to try it.
Best store to shop- Italy especially if you like those aqua di Parma perfumes.
Best attraction for the little ones Norways Frozen. Fireworks show is always a blast."
So many construction walls.,They are doing so much construction in the central area and at the entrance that we were getting lost trying to get from one side of the park to the other. This park is needing something besides festivals to attract me again.
Waste of TIME and MONEY!!!,"Overpriced theme park!! We paid 300$ for 1 day pass but we were able to do only 1 attraction (Nemo! Lol). Very RUDE cast members.
Fortunately we were able to get our money back from the credit card company.
Better to go to Universal or Seaworld .."
"Mission space interactive area, be careful, my daughter smacked by adult","While the ride is fine and my daughter loves it, Disney management needs to fix the interactive area, specifically the “boost” button near the front at the large screens. The person playing needs to quickly run behind them to the boost to keep the game going. While doing so, an adult smacked my daughter waiting her turn who is 7 and did not even apologize being more concerned with keeping her game going. My daughter just wanted to leave after that. I tried to find a cast member but no one was in the area. As annual Passholders, I know and certainly cast members “unofficially” know many guests leave their brains and dignity in their hotel rooms. I hope they fix this and move the boost button before someone gets hurt if it has not happened already."
Great ride!,"I know some reviews say this ride is outdated but always a pleasure to go on. A quick review of some historical things and still, in my opinion, as good as ever! My son joked that when he was younger a question on a test was about paper with the answer being ""papyrus"" and he remembered it from this ride!! HAHA I know they are planning updates at some point but if you get a chance ride away! It's right at the entrance of Epcot, can't miss it! Going to miss this version when the update does happen. It's ok that somethings stay the same! Have fun at Epcot!!"
Business and pleasure time,"Excellent experience visiting Epcot during Food and wine expo. great selections small portions were perfect Allowed for many tastings
Best firework laser light show ever
Very enjoyable...wear comfortable shoes, lot of walking
Get the fast pass for skipping the lines"
Best Day Ever,We had a great day at the food and wine festival November 19th. We were able to experience all the top attractions multiple times without long waits. The tremendous variety of unique foods was terrific. We enjoyed every item we tried. The new fireworks show is fantastic. We loved the kites.
Epcot Food and Wine,"Best things we ate at the Food and Wine fesitival were the American Pavillion (lobster roll and full size beer-note everwhere is 3 oz wine or 6 oz beers,i,e, they are just tastings but leaves you wanting more). The Austrailian Pavillion, the deconstructed pavlova- the perect end to eating your way around Epcot. Inside the Gran Fiesta Pavvillion is a small tequila bar, had one of the flights of tequila along with the tro of appetizers (chips & salsa, guacamole and queso dip-guac ws awesome). Note that the food and wine festival only runs from Sept- mid Nov."
lotus Blossom cafe,"We had counter service at the lotus blossom cafe we all enjoyed the food there, We all had different meals and shared them between us very nice just like a take away at home"
Construction,"EPCOT is into a major facelift.
The entry leading toward the geodesic dome greatly is changed with removal of the plinths featuring people who bought remembrance engravings (these will be reconfigured later). Once past the dome, work barriers define the west side. We were at EPCOT for this year's and last year's Food and Wine Festival. This year's crowds did not seem to flow as well perhaps due to the works in progress.
We anticipate the renewed EPCOT in a few year's time."
So so disappointed!,My husband and I travel to WDW frequently and this visit to Epcot was so disappointing. The holiday decor was very very sparse to say the least with the exception of a few countries on World Showcase. The worst part was all the construction everywhere and I do mean everywhere. Don’t expect much here apparently until 2021.
Wine and Food Week,My husband and I had such a wonderful experience at the wine and food fest this week. Everything was delish but expensive. You would think they would offer items at a cheaper rate. But it was a once in a life time and worth it
"Boring, busy, building site","Visited during food and wine festival. Gave up looking for interesting gluten free dishes - they were few and far between. Ended up eating a cheesecake (with no base) for lunch because there was so little choice. Garden Grill for dinner was OK but very expensive and salty meat/fries. I really wish the food was healthier. Soarin was amazing, if not a little distorted visually (on screen). The building work I understand is necessary but looked horrible - why not offer reduced prices? No chance of getting on the Frozen ride - queues too long. Not enough signage of where everything is and was given incorrect directions from a cast member - a wrong turn is costly in terms of exhaustion, timings and the sheer size of the parks. Missed a fastpass because of it."
Ok,"A busy park with not alot going on.We were there for the food and wine festival which takes place around the lake.
You can walk around it taking in a multitude of different countries food and drinks.(expensive and small portions).But you can get a pint of Guinness at the uk part of the park.(11$).
The kids least favourite park out of al the disney parks.ages ranged from 5-16.
Saying that Soarin is one of the best rides out of all the disney parks for me, only beaten by avatar at animal kingdom.I wouldn't plan to stay too long at this park a day would have been more than enough if you have fast passes to use Soarin,Frozen and Test Track are the best rides at the park I would also recommend going on these late as possible to incorporate the firework show at the end of the night.
Hope you find this helpful"
Eat and drink around the world,"We were there during the food and wine festival which we enjoyed. Epcot is a unique experience, there aren't as many rides as other parks but Soaring is the best ride we have ever experienced."
My Daycation at Epcot,"Epcot always amazes me, especially because the park offers so much to enjoy. The Disney Imagineering and schedule coordination are quintessential examples of what human brains are capable of doing for our world.
I have an Epcot After Four Florida Resident annual pass; the ride from Ocala via the Turnpike and the 429 is direct and avoids the heavy I-4 traffic. Epcot is great for me because I am a senior citizen and don't really want to mingle with the crowds of little kids who visit the other three Disney World parks. For me, Epcot is like a museum.
Epcot is making a lot of changes, so the construction barriers seem to be in all areas of the park. I look forward to the new structures.
The""cast members"" are all pleasant.
The food prices are crazy, but after giving this much thought, l conclude that the less people eat, the less they will use the toilet facilities. Therefore, the facilities are not abused and are well maintained.
I don't like the darkness in the park. Disney is super cheap about the lighting. This is not safe. Is Disney looking to invite pickpockets and touchy-feely weirdos to Epcot? How can one recognize an offender in such crowded darkness?
Another thing Disney can improve upon is the sound of announcements in the monorails and on the attractions. Volume is too low and often drowned out by music or sound spill over from other nearby sections.
The fireworks are beautiful."
Still a great attraction. Plenty to see and experience.,This was my first time back to Epcot in about three years and it did not disappoint. The mission to Mars took my breath away and was quite a unique experience. My favorite was the race track which was speedy exciting and I want to go on it again and again. Space ship earth was entertaining and still quite a relaxing and educational ride.
Some rides need to be upgraded.,My husband and I went here during a weekend away without the kids. The food and wine fest was in full swing and we had a good time marking the rounds to several different countries to purchase samples of their food. There aren’t as many rides at this park as in the other parks and a couple of them are very outdated. They could definitely use an upgrade of the rides. After spending several hours in the park we headed back to the hotel for some much needed rest. We kinda ran out of things to do in the park besides eat. We came back at night which was really beautiful as the Epcot ball was illuminated in a rainbow of colors.
Best family trip dver,My family is having an absolute blast at Epcot. We went on Spaceship Earth and Soarin and so far had a great time. There’s so much more to see including the Epcot Food and Wine Festival. I can’t wait to go and see them.
Around the world I’m eight(y) hours,"My daughter got to meet Elsa and Anna so our trip was complete then. Highlights for
Me were taking my family on spaceship earth. Looking forward to that update I’m future trips. Loved the Japanese supermarket and the kidcot stations. We got lucky and met Mickey, chip and dale with no line. Positives far outweighed negatives. Lots of character interactions and opportunities to meet.
Negatives:
1. Construction but looking forward to seeing what’s done
2. Only park with a wait to get in but it was our only weekend visit.
3. Turtle Talk with crush was less than great and felt like a real waste of a fast pass. Lesson learned."
Great Visit,We attended the Wine and Food Festival here. The food was pretty good. Beverages good. Not too crowded.
Great fun!,Great Way to see the world on foot - and enjoy great food along the way. There was excellent service and cast was outstanding- will definitely return again
Run down park,"Upon arrival we thought we'd travelled back in time, the park & rides are dated - I read that they're improving things so hopefully it gets better. The round the world stalls proving food & drink are cool to look at but I wouldn't recommend going after a certain time with children as there's a lot of drunks & it's very crowded."
Reflections...,"Please update the film in the China pavilion! It looked to be about 20+ years old. The skyscrapers they showed have long been built. There was a family from China with us and they looked amused by the film and how old it was. The Morocco pavilion, specifically the cafe there, really felt we were in Marrakech and reminded us of a past vacation. I really liked the World Expo concept.
Overall, one of my favourite parks on our trip. We chanced upon an unexpected performance by Boyz II Men which was cool. My 7 year old daughter got briefly lost in the thousands of people that were there on a wet and stormy night. The Disney security staff were helpful in looking for her and gave her a popsicle to calm her down when we were reunited. Fortunately, she was only apart from us for 10 minutes although it felt much longer!"
Fun!,"Although it’s was an eight mile hike and I’m 69, I really liked Epcot and will return!
A must see in Orlando!"
Food and wine,"Food and wine festival was very busy over the weekend. Lines were long but the food is worth the wait (and price). I highly recommend Food and Wine Fest. Also, I recommend row 1 of Soaring ride."
A lot of building,We came here and there is a lot of building work going on. Some part of the park was closed so we just had to make do with what was left. Soaring is a very good ride where you travel around the world and some senses are sparked by scents. Test track is also a good ride and try getting a fast pass for both as they are very popular. The Mission space ride is pretty good. There is a green ride which is quite tame. Then you have the orange ride which pushes you back into your seat with the g force!! It can make you feel quite nauseous and this is reflected with the sick bags on the dash board ! If you have motion sickness or don’t like small closed spaces don’t go on this. It’s a simulation ride and it’s pretty good. The rest of the park needs a bit of upgrading done as the big ride there is space mountain which has been there for a really a long time. Epcot is also not as busy as the Magic Kingdom . Still a fab place to go
Fun break,"Beautifully decorated
Great foods
Wonderful rides
Be a kid again and just enjoy
The monorail is great transportation
Use the new skyline and beat the crowds it’s an incredible ride day or night"
A NICE MIX OF THEME PARK AND CULTURE,"My wife and I have visited Epcot off and on for years and we always enjoy our visit. While some of the restaurants can be very pricey, there is always something to see, do and learn when you visit. We highly recommend Epcot be part of anyone's visit to Disney World."
Best Character Meets Here!,"If you are looking for character meets, food, wine and culture then look no further - Epcot is the place to be. The frozen ride was great and the aquarium too, I would recommend the food festival season!"
"Epcot, also known as Disney's building site","I have no idea what is going on here but they have literally closed 1/3 of the park, i assume to rebuild it with newer attractions. I therefore expect to have 1/3 of my ticket refunded?
Test track was great, and with fastpass the queue was minimal. Some of the other rides are in need of a bit of TLC, it feels like half of Epcot has been ignored compared to the other parks.
The aquarium was pretty good, as was Soarin'. The world expo was also fairly good, only complaint was the Ireland stall, the food wasn't great and tasted like a school dinner."
A Great Time,"Epcot is a great experience in my humble opinion. I love visiting the different countries, and experiencing the rides. Had a really great time."
Great Park,"Of course you have to visit epcot if your doing all of the disney parks, but I would say least fave of an amazing bunch really.
MUST do the race track ride!"
Always a favorite!,"It had been 15 since we had been able to go and it was great to be able to go. Love the countries, the buildings, and the food. Always enjoy Space Ship Earth, the Fast Track, and Soarin. First time with the Fast Pass, at times it worked out well and other times not so much."
Another good park,A bit more adult themed went here a few times while in Disney. Good park loved sorin ride and test track thought the fire works where ok but seen better. Had a nice time walking around we where there during the wine and food festival. It’s ok during the week but Saturday. Did not really feel like a Disney park lots of drunk and noisy people around and felt more like a night out on the town so just be aware of that when this event is on
Enjoyable experience with our family,"As a kid, Epcot was my least favourite park. I absolutely love what Disney has done to make it more 'kid' friendly. My kids loved it here. The passports for kids was what kept them interested! We happened to be at the park for their food and wine festival, which was brilliant. We had a fantastic day and enjoyed ourselves very much. My only suggestion to Disney would be to have a few more GF options available for the food and wine festival. I found that the majority of the kiosks that had GF options were clustered in one spot, and as I made my around the pavilions, food choices for me were few and far between unless I stopped to have a full 'meal' at one of the restaurants."
Dissapointed,Was really looking forward to Epcot and all it had to offer . We visited both day time and evening. 1st visit was a day visit and the weather was bad heavy rain most of the day we still found plenty to do as was determined to not let the rain spoil our day. Lots of closures of attractions and lots of building and referb work going on so not the nicest of scenery. 2nd visit was on an evening and Epcot looked really pretty in the dark food and wine festival was on so the park was so busy you could hardly walk lots of good food on offer and eat to the beat concert was a bonus . Best tip is Les Halles for a full baguette for $3 fresh full bread just take your own filling biggest bargain in Disney.. We felt that after two trips to this park was enough for our needs so never went back during our two week stay.
"Walking, viewing and eating","Plenty to see and taste at this amazing attraction that has many exciting rides and international cuisines. Visiting all the countries and tasting their food can easily take all day. Reserve the evening for dinning at one of the many international restaurants. We ate at Monsieur Paul's, the 5 star French restaurant that caters to foodies who don't mind spending a lot on fine food and elegant atmosphere. If possible get a table next to a window to view happenings below. One of the highlights was the Chinese pavilion which features a 360 degree video of China. Also don't miss the race track ride that allows you to design your own future auto and then test it on the track. The ride itself is breathtaking and fun. Shows and fireworks top off the evening's entertainment. Even though pricey, there is much to see and do at this Disney attraction."
Eat and Drink Your Way Around the World!,"Wine and Dine did not disappoint! So much to do and see at Epcot. Love, love the sweet red wine in Italy. Eating in Mexico is really cool under the sky and take the ride its a quick one. Soarin' is a must do and so is Test Track."
Under construction - wait until completed,"There is som icy construction going on in the ‘future world’ wide of the park that it was a mistake to go to Epcot. The ‘sea’ and ‘land’ pavilions are pretty weak, except for ‘soaring’, but that’s not really enough for that whole side. The Guardians ride is under construction, mission to Mars is Ho-hum and the test track is out of service a lot. (It was closed almost the whole time we were there - NOT scheduled maintenance.).
Personally, we won’t be back until all the construction is completed."
Epcot under renovations,"Epcot is usually a great place to visit. However, it's under renovations currently which means half the park is boarded up. August 28 to November 23 is food and wine festival which makes it a horrible experience, as you wait in long lines to try a small portion of food that's horribly expensive to try along with so so wine pairings. I had checked Disney's website, but not once did it say that Epcot was under renovations. I would have picked another time to come here if I had known."
Lots of Refurbishment,"There is lots going on in Epcot at present which is much needed, it will be amazing when finished. The World Showcase is always amazing and so interesting we love it here."
Incredibly Poor Experience,"Returned to Epcot, having not visited since childhood. Guess what? Nothing has been updated in those 30 years, except that half the park seems closed/boarded up. We went during the 'food and wine festival'. What this means is that people cue in lines for 30-40 minutes while wearing drinking themed t-shirts to get a bit of wine and bite of food. I love a good glass of wine and am no prude, but I sorely resent paying roughy 100 dollars a person just to enter (plus serious additional fees for food/wine events) to be offered a huge cue of people, a series of gift shops, and little to nothing else. We thought there'd be lots of culturally themed events in the different 'countries', but didn't see that or really anything else happening. I also don't understand at all the value proposition from Disney on this park or the 'cheek' to keep it going when so much seemed to be closed or under construction (which was not disclosed in advance). Disney Springs is a better venue and it's FREE. I'm aware of the crowds and short-comings of visiting a Disney property, but even with that perspective, I was shocked at the poor offering from an organization that prides itself on guest experience. Simply awful."
Food and Rides,"Epcot is different from the other parks. All the other are character and Disney focused, as where Epcot is more world focused. The rides are fun, but there are only 3 main focus rides, which are Mission Space, Soaring and Test Track. MISSION space is a spinning ride where you sit in a pod and it spins and raises you around while you stare at a screen, blasting you off into space. It is intense. Soaring is a flight around the world to the wonders. Test track is a ride where you speed around a racetrack.
The main focus of Epcot is the food. The world food fair allows you to test food from all over the world. It is quite nice to try new things.
Honestly, Epcot would be the bottom of my rank for all the parks."
Great place to try different foods.,"This part of Disney world has several different rides. The Land was a favorite. There is also a Pixar theater show that was better than we expected. Try to ride the Frozen boats if you like the movie. This is the place to try different foods from other countries. I suggest trying the smaller outside food places unless you really need to have sit down restaurant meals. The food places outside most countries have smaller and more inexpensive choices of similar foods. We enjoyed the China, Morocco and German places."
Food & Wine Festival Great - Rides Just Okay,"The good first - the food and wine festival is a lot of fun and we had fun eating our way around the world. The ribs in China were very good and our favourite was the meat pie from Africa.
The average - most of the rides are dated, we enjoyed the Frozen boat ride and said it was better than the N’avi river journey in Animal Kingdom. Soarin’ was a bit disappointing, it feels like a worse version of Flight of Passage and the images on the screen were bent which was weird. Spaceship Earth was okay. Test Track was pretty good.
The bad - Mission Space. The orange level made me feel so ill, there is plenty of warning that it’s intense so it’s my fault for doing it anyway but this ride made me want to throw up. Do it at your own peril!
Overall we enjoyed Epcot but not sure how good it would be outside of the food and wine festival."
Love Epcot,"This was my second visit to Epcot and it’s awesome! Despite getting nauseous five minutes into the park on the space simulation ride, the visit was great! The various smells of the food in each country is amazing and I highly recommend tasting as many things as you can! I believe it was Norway where we tried two pastries in a bakery that we really weren’t sure what they were...we couldn’t pronounce them but they were delicious!
While I loved it here, I’m not sure kids would love it as much! It was very neat to experience but not quite as interactive for kids as some other Disney attractions!"
Under construction,"Was a great pak but hakf of it seamed to be under construction and there was a lot of fences in the futureworld are due to redesign.
World Showcase was great and Norway pavillion was fantastic! Loved to meet Anna Elsa.
Expect Long walkibg distances since its a HUGE park. Took me half an hour to walk between Norway and parks exit."
In need of an update,I visited Epcot the first summer it opened. Thirty six years later little has changed. Future world attraction displays still show the same IBM tape reels from 1983. Epcot needs a reboot.
lots of walking required,"really good but not too many rides here, Soarin and Test Track our favourite 2, Frozen over hyped, very jolty and not worth it unless you can grab a fast pass"
Avoid - Construction Site and Drunken Party Venue,"My last visit was in October 2013 and at that time it was my favourite Disney park. Based on this visit I shall not be returning, how Disney can charge the price they do for walking through a construction site is beyond me. I know you have to update and change but with this amount of construction the admission price should be reduced or the park closed altogether.
The Food and Wine festival is now nothing but an expensive gimmick and what used to be a park for family has turned into a park for adults wanting to party. I have never seen so many drunken adults in a Disney park, shouting and throwing up in the restrooms.
The food offer has deteriorated and what has happened to the staff, a number of them have no interest in what they are doing and can only just manage to mutter a few words. In Electric Umbrella in Future World I ordered a Hot Chocolate, server on till was really helpful with my parent who had difficulty hearing but the server at the counter just pushed a tray with two empty cups and our food choice towards us, no a word was spoken on where to get drinks or even a hello or good day. Walked to to Chocolate machine only for a sign saying it was not in use but use one at another station? Well if I could find another machine I would have used it but there was not. I asked a staff member how to get Hot Chocolate and all I got was its at the station and they walked on. Asked another staff member and they said the same, when I explained it was nor working she went off to find out what was going on, eventually coming back with two sachets of Chocolate Powder and saying machines are not working you should have been given these! Food was overpriced and just edible but we did send one meal back as it was awful manager returned with a box of fries as a gesture.
So after 4 visits this will be my last, infact the other members in my party who have been here before said the same, and the one who had so wanted to visit for the first time was totally disappointed.
One positive thing to mention was the friendliness and helpfulness of Jim and his colleague working alongside the Yorkshire County Fish Shop on the entrance to a private party. They are how we remember Disney Employees,"
A bit tired but worth visiting!,"This Park was a mixed bag for us - not one of our favourites but far from the worst Disney experience we have had.
The Frozen ride is easily the best attraction at the park. The characters and songs are done really well, even people who have not seen the movie would appreciate it. It is visually and aurally impressive and has a great classic feel to it, with very clever use of technology.
Other than Frozen, there aren’t that many rides in the Park you want to do over and over.
Test Track is okay but not amazing. Even with a Fastpass, you have to wait a while designing your car, as well as just plain waiting. The inside part of the ride itself was better than we thought it would be, and the outside bit where it goes fast was cool but is a bit industrial, plain, and un-Disney. The only comparable ride in the Disney canon is Radiator Springs Raceway in Anaheim which absolutely blows Test Track out of the water. It was also really corny and felt like you were in a 90's advertisement for Chevrolet.
Soaring was okay but, again, you have to wait a while even with a Fastpass or a small queue. It is a much better experience if you are in the first/top row as you don’t see anyone’s feet! We didn't find the CGI cheesy as some reviewers do. Again, felt like quite a dated ride, with unimaginative locations chosen.
Living with the Land is a funny one, it felt a bit old too, and the outside of the boats looked a bit slimy and dirty. Still it’s good to have something a bit different even if it is a bit weird.
Although the Nemo ride was okay and not great, we were amazed to find the real dolphins at the end and all the other marine life. This made for a great experience and really made the Park a bit special and surprising.
Spaceship Earth was peculiar but we enjoyed it. Again, some of it felt dated and even smelt like a musty museum. Also, a sign of its time that the majority of the animatronics are men, and it doesn't reference the developments throughout the world, but just in a few select places e.g. Where was China throughout history? The bit where they put you in a video is hilarious, the fact it is a bit old and naff adds to the experience. You want to do it again just for the video alone.
We weren’t big fans of Mission Space, it seemed a bit pointless and claustrophobic, although definitely seems like a major inspiration for the Smuggler's Run ride, with use of the interactive buttons, flying through space, and each rider getting a special role to play. In our opinion, Mission Space actually used the interactive feature better than Smuggler's Run does.
The Fastpass system works relatively well at Epcot and you can get much more value out of it than at Hollywood Studios. Rope dropping is also more effective than at other parks- we were able to walk right on to Frozen and then do it again with a few minutes wait.
We spent far more time in Future World than at the World Showcase. World Showcase looked okay but we are not big fans of Disney shops and expensive food stalls/restaurants, and even with the Food and Wine Festival on, it didn’t really grab our interest. Also, we had been to DisneySea recently, which blows away World Showcase in terms of how big and impressive the themed areas are so we were probably expecting too much.
One thing we didn’t like about Epcot is how you have to walk quite long distances, even within Future World, through bland paved areas with little theming. Walking from Test Track through the middle to Soaring feels just like an unimaginative city centre, and lacks the Disney touch. The building Soaring is in also feels like a dull retro Convention Centre - we could not figure out why so many people were sitting around there doing nothing all the time.
As for the highlight; it’s a little dinosaur named Figment. We left loving the song, loving Eric Idle even more, and loving what is otherwise a fairly naff but positive and upbeat ride. Figment is such a winning character, he manages to turn Epcot from a middle of the road theme park to a park with a magnet pulling you to return.
The best tip we have is to rope drop from the International Gateway entrance. It is by far the most laidback and comfortable rope drop experience we have had. To get to this entrance, we Ubered to the Beach Club and walked through the resort and out through a little known door (thanks to AJ at Disney Food Blog for this great tip, though you could also come via one of the other nearby Resorts).The main entrance by comparison takes ages to get in and out of, with the buses and Ubers a long walk away and quite a bit of traffic slowing things down.
Overall, a good park worth visiting, but we felt you did not need to spend as much time here as at your typical Disney 'castle' park."
Food and Wine Festival was a Drunken mess,"We love Epcot! It's one of our favorite parks. We will never come back when the food and wine festival is going on. There were crowds of inebriated adults acting loud and obnoxious. There were girls twerking with two beers in their hands. It just wasn't a place for my kids to be. I didn't realize that this has become such a party place for adults. I felt like it was Spring break for 30 year olds and up. It was weird! Adults in groups wearing t-shirts with sayings on them about how they are about to get wasted in Disney. I was embarrassed for them and as many of them stumbled around the park I felt unsafe for my children. Unfortunately, we skipped the entire cultural section because it was so bad. Disney needs to take this party elsewhere...drunk adults and children do not mix at all. Completely disgusted with the behavior at Epcot. Never again!"
Pretty dated,"I had always wanted to go to Epcot. Well, I can scratch it off my bucket list, but that is about it. In 1982 it may have been interesting, but for today, it was a very dated money pit. The countries represented seemed more there to take your money than to showcase them."
Wondrous,"As to septuagenarians traveling without grandchildren, we totally enjoyed Epcot. The rides are great, the crowds are interesting and the staff are Knowledgeable, efficient, and more than polite. The firework show was great and the entry and exit to the park work amazingly easy considering they admit over 100,000 people on a typical day. For us, storing was the best ride followed by the land and of course Mexico. We had dinner at the German display and it was fantastic."
"Long lines, lots of construction","First visit with our grandson. Was disappointed with the lines, the construction, and the crowd. We waited in line for the test track for 40+ minutes, only to have it shut down for unexplained reasons. In general, lines were long, for a short experience. I was hoping for him to have a great experience (he is 9 years old), he was disappointed missing the test track, he loves cars, talked extensively about how he was going to balance power, capability, responsiveness, and wasn’t interested in efficiency so much. He did enjoy the space flight to mars.
Food was overpriced for value ( Germany buffet)"
Overpriced and my least favorite park,"I personally dislike this park! Other than a few rides, there is nothing it offers that is worth the ridiculous entrance price.
The restaurants in every country (as we did indeed try them all when we go there) all taste the same. The food is no different from a crappy restaurant coating a lot less money.
Save your money and don't bother with this park"
Epcot Orlando,"We had a lot of fun with different attractions: Soarin, Launch to the Space, The Botanic garden. We loved the part of Japan, the Tori, the store, it reminded us our trip to Japan! And of course, at night, the firework!!!!"
Nothing to see here,"We paid for fast pass and when we tried to use it we were told that we needed to register and book our intended visits. as we did not know what was on offer we didn’t know what we should do. Park is tired and run down. Directions and helpful staff were few and far between. Exhibits are pitched at eight year olds. On top of expensive entrance ticket, parking fee was exorbitant. NOt recommend for older people with life experiences. Waste of time and money. Food and wine trail expensive for minuscule tastings. Don’t bother."
2019 International Food & Wine Festival,The festival is from August 29 - November 23; my festival favorites are The steakhouse blended burger from flavors from fire; baked shrimp and scallop scampi dip from coastal eats; maple bourbon cheesecake from the cheese studio; shaken Jamaican with baileys; smokey margarita from mexico; schofferhofer hefeweizen pomegranate beer from brewer's collection; charcuterie in a cone from Spain; spicy rolls and plum wine from japan; croissant aux escargot from France; Guinness baileys shake from Ireland; apple blossom sky from Appleseed orchard;
Amazing Time!,We were at Epcot for three days for the wine and food festival. It was an amazing time. We went with several friends and we found the park to be great. At night we were able to rent a boat to take to the fireworks which was really nice. You can bring your own drinks and food and sit and enjoy the fireworks with great seats. I would highly recommend as you do not have to fight the crowds.
A great time,"Epcot is a great park. It is twice the size as the Magic Kingdom, so you will put on some walking miles. Epcot is more of an adult park, there are not many rides at this park, but there is a lot of dining and drinking choices. I believe Epcot has the best dining of the four parks. World showcase is a treat to just take a slow walk around and enjoy the different countries. The most popular rides are Soarin’, Test Track and Frozen, all require separate fast-pass’."
Love! Love! Love!,Make sure you visit Mexico and take the boat ride thru the canal- and visit the gift shop where they have so many awesome things!
My favorite,"Epcot is my favorite park. They are starting the massive overhaul of future world and there are a lot of construction walls, but it is still an amazing park. The world showcase is beautiful. Take your time and enjoy each country."
Wine and Food Festival 2019,Great time at the festival and the park. My wife and I spent an entire day here. Everything was delicious and the food was great. Rides are okay at this park but it isn't the real reason we came. Love coming here for this event.
Lovely day out,"The park is Greta but by far my favourite section was the walk around the lake where you visit countries from around the world. The Morocco section reminded us of our recent holiday there. We had ice cream and Prosecco in ‘Italy’ and even enjoyed a pint in the pub in ‘England’.
We also enjoyed the boat ride in Mexico and the exhibition of art in Japan. A great way to spend an afternoon.
We also enjoyed the lights and firework show on the lake at the end of the evening."
Just okay,"We booked 2 Disney parks for 2 days, animal kingdom being the other and did epcot first, a little disappointed as it was not what we were expecting, not to say the staff/condition of the park was anything other than amazing, we personally were just expecting more rides and things to do/see other than (fantastic) scenery which turned out to be gift shops on the inside. If we had our time again we would do hollywood instead or more likely animal kingdom twice."
Fun for everyone,"In our group of four, we ranged in age from 24 to 63. We all loved the whole experience from the moment we walked in we snacked and drank our way around the world, enjoyed a free concert, and experienced a short rocket ship ride. Worth every penny!"
We love EPCOT,We’ve been going to EPCOT for years and we love it. There’s lots to do and see and fun for the whole family
International Food Festival was a blast,"Only 4 stars as this Disney Park has the poorest signage of any Disney Park. Love Animal Kingdom as it had terrific signage. International Food Experience was truly a hit and miss. France was our number one choice with the beef, creme brûlée which were incredible. Would strongly recommend going in the evening after daylight savings time has ended as it was 93 on November 7th when we were there."
Educational and not as busy as Animal Kingdom or Magic Kingdom,"Food and Wine fair is amazing. Great idea. I really enjoyed Epcot and it's diverse displays and attractions. Cool rides with reasonable lines. Lots of food and rest spots for hot days. Staff seem to be happier here, maybe because the lines are manageable?"
International Food festival,"Epcot is an amazing place to go but the International Food Festival makes it extra special . This was our 5th year there.
If you attempt to go to every booth, which we do, it can get very pricey. They may want to standardize and set a price for the food across all booths. They can profit probably on the alcohol sold alone, so keep the food pricing within reach.
There were a few misses when it came to the food but overall it was all great."
Love the food & wine festival,"We love to visit Epcot while the food & wine festival is on. We particularly enjoy the wine and cheese, Canadian beef, English fish & chips (see my Rose & Crown pub review) and lots of different drinks on our way round. We enjoy the shops and the entertainment such as the mime act in Italy and the mariachi band in Mexico. It costs you money but so does everything you do in Florida!"
Looking old and tired,"We were disappointed with the sad, tired looking effort at EPCOT. Most of the attractions are very low level, poor nutrition, food outlets. Food is also overpriced."
Not for us,For us it just seemed small a 1/2 day park. Our party had 3 adults and a 7 yr old. Rides were so so except for Soaring Over America was great. Don't ever plan to return to Epcot
Biggest Disappointment of My Trip,"It was my first time ever to Disney World. I was really excited about Epcot. I love to travel so the concept seemed up my alley. Not to mention we were going during Food and Wine Festival, two other things I love. However I was sort of let down.
This park didn't seem to have the magic as some of the other parks. The area around the Epcot globe seems a little outdated and though the Spaceship Earth ride was fun, it needs some updating as well. I did enjoy Soarin, Test Track, Living with the Land, and the Frozen ride. However, that was about it. There really are not a lot of rides or shows at this park.
Each of the countries pretty much only have shops and restaurants. They are cute but I've been to some of those countries and it felt very commercialized; and not like you've left the USA.
The whole park seems geared at just getting you to spend tons of money, and you already spent a lot to get in. The Food and Wine thing was cool but each stand you had to spend like $5-$8 per plate to try something. The food was super good but the cost adds up quickly. I understand that they can't give it all away for free, but I would suggest they give each guest 4-5 tickets that they could cash in to try a few things for free.
You pay a lot to get into a Disney Park, and for the other 3 parks, what you get is worth it. Its not in this case. Few rides and the festival designed to get you to spend more money. I'm glad I finally went to experience it, but not sure this would be one park I will return to."
One major issue,"This was our least favorite park for our family. There was one major reason for that... construction everywhere in the future world section. This park is outdated and I understand the need for updates however it is too much at once in my opinion. However, we still had a number of highlights here, Garden Grill was our favorite character dining experience overall for this trip. Also enjoyed Akershus Royal Table for breakfast, you will meet most of the princesses there. There 3 or 4 very good, fun rides. Test Track was easily our favorite however again was down until early afternoon which is a common occurrence for this attraction. I would NOT use my tier 1 fast pass on it. I would recommend to use that on Frozen Ever After, a fun dark ride with excellent theming. Soarin is solid but not as good as a similar ride at Mall of America called Fly Over America. I still recommend to spend a day at this park especially for the festivals down at World Showcase, however young kids seem to get bored because of the lack of kid friendly attractions. For are family of 4 though we prefer the other parks, I am sure once the park gets the full facelift by 2022 this park will be higher rated by us."
Visit with family !,"Last visited EPCOT 14yrs ago still mostly the same just renamed some rides attractions, construction work going
on maybe be more up to date when completed!
Grandchildren enjoyed meeting Frozen characters and having photos taken with the memory makers.
Mostly a good park but lot of walking needed!"
Around the world in a day,We went for the food and wine. It was great tasting all the different foods and drinks.Expect to spend around $100 or so. There's 11 countries and in between different countries like hawaii with the pork sliders yummy. we also had a flight of beer and mamosa. tasty. go with an open mind and tast buds.
A very good and enjoyable park,"Having been to EPCOT in the early 80's, a lot of the original rides have not changed and are in need of an update. That aside, this is a very good park. Soaring' is one the best rides in all of Disney World. Not to be missed. Be sure to see American Adventure. I really enjoy the spring and fall concert series. Plenty of food choices."
Food and Wine 2019,Lots of new and exciting food and drinks. I ate around the world. My favorites are the Maple Bourbon Cheese cake and the Mac and cheese in the active eats pavilion. I can't wait to go back and drink around the world on my next trip.
Wine and food festival,"It was my first time to Epcot. I really enjoyed each ""country"" experience including the food and shops. The fireworks were impressive at night. Dinner was delicious at Morrocco (beef kabobs). Only downside is the cost. So I figure once and done!"
"Great variety, Good Quality, but not Inexpensive","It has been many years since we were at Epcot and it seems better than I remember. The national villages around the lake offer a wide variety of foods. For those, like us, who don;t want to commit a meal to only1 country, there are kiosks serving 3 to 5 dishes that are good representatives of the national cuisine. We sampled many and have the credit card bills to prove it! The separation of the order/pay station from the food delivery is very efficient, so even long lines moved quickly. From time to time, performers at the various national areas would provide music and entertainment. Overall a good experience."
Disappointed ....,"I have been waiting almost 40 years to go to EPCOT. Finally on Sunday 11/3 we went. $295 just to get two of us parked and through the gates...yowser , talk about sticker shock!!
We plowed our way through Futureworld to get to the World Showcase. Spoiler alert: Sunday is a bad time to go plus the Food and Wine Festival was going on. A road race was either in progress or just finishing. The crowds were horrific. And it was hard to find ""cast members"" for asking directions.
Ok, it is amazing to visit a couple dozen countries in one day but I feel we paid a bunch of money for the privilege of buying food and souvenirs/stuff. It was like going to Disney Springs with a HUGE admission charge. Entertainment was scattered throughout and what we were able to see (mariachi cobre and the French street acrobat were A++)
The rides we could get on were frankly cheesy and worn out. While some venues were closed for renovations and new attractions, promising new wonders, we just are not interested in going back.
I guess I am ok that I finally got to experience EPCOT but next trip to Florida will be to the competitor's theme parks."
"Always the most fun, always an adventure, and always treated very well by everyone","Yes I got my ears, and my name embroidered on the back of it, ha ha ha, but I was at Epcot many times over the years, and it never fails to be a wonderful time. Some years back, my children even got to march with their high school band all the way around Epcot, in the evening, in the darkness. It was wonderful then, and still is now. Take your time, watch the shows and enjoy the many varieties of food they have, it is perfect. The shuttle service to each of the parks and hotels is so wonderful, you dont have to worry about the car, parking or traffic, just get on and go. Easy to figure out, easy to use."
Older teen really appreciated,"Took my 19 yr old yesterday, his choice of parks. He had been at age 6 and 11 prior. This time really enjoyed Epcot beyond test track. We laughed joyfully on the kid themed rides, Nemo especially, and he really appreciated the artistry of the rest. Loved the countries, the food and shopping. Great day topped off with fantastic fireworks. Another great Disney memory!!"
This was awsome,You have to go best place. AWSOME food. The best. The rides are very good. And you can see every place in the world.
Great evening,Epcot is the best at night I believe. But walking around and enjoying all the different countries is great. And with a few rides makes it perfect.
Still my Favourite Disney Attraction,"This was our 10th visit (over a period of 25 years). The structures and buildings still impress and the rides still thrill - though we are 25 years older now than when we started. Some areas need updating to keep pace with the world and get get ahead of tech again. This is happening now - with extensive building work going on around the entrance to the park. It’s being hidden well, but does detract from the “wow” feeling one usually gets when arriving.
The Test Track ride is a must-do every time. The Food and Wine Festival is and event well worth planning for."
The 4th best Disney world park,"If you have never been to Epcot, be prepared to walk, and walk, and walk. The entire park surrounds a big “lake” and in the back are all the various countries which is also where most of the restaurants are as well. In the front of the park are most of the rides as well. The best ride is soarin’ which is a simulator type ride that is like riding on a hang glider. It was very fun and great for kids who may be a little nervous on roller coaster type rides. Then comes test track which is a car crash test dummy type ride that is also similar to a roller coaster as well. The comes mission space. This is a rocket launch simulator that has two versions. One version is an extreme version and the other is more tame.
After these three rides there really isn’t anything that enjoyable. All the rides are simple slow moving rides that aim to teach you things. It’s interesting, but I would not say super exciting. Then there is the frozen part of the park. This is where all the young kids run to and consists of a ride and the ability to meet Elsa and Anna. The ride is actually fun. There are some parts on it that I did not expect and made it a ride I would have done again.
Again, be prepared to walk. In a single 9 hour day at Epcot we walked 8.7 miles. You can cut this down by taking the water ferry. You just need to time it right or the wait can be pretty long and not make it feel worth it"
Right now avoid until completed,"How Disney can charge full price for half a park I don’t know...no rides really and test track closing.....don’t waste your. Momey guys,,,"
I love Disney!,I went to Epcot and had the time of my life! This park is a good combination of rides and places to see. All of the countries are interesting to visit and I took pictures with lots of Disney characters in different countries. Morocco was my favorite country because princess jasmine was there and the restaurant in that country had a belly dancer for entertainment while I had a delicious lamb dinner. I visited In October so the lines weren’t too bad. My strategy for Epcot was arriving early and getting on the most popular rides first thing and then I visited countries for awhile and then I rode more rides and then I had dinner. After dinner I strolled around a few more countries and rode a few more rides and then went home. I was there during the international food festival but I didn’t really try too many different foods. This is a great park if you’re not trying to ride a lot of rides because there is a nice balance of other things to do.
Dated park,"The world showcase is great but the rest of the park is tired & old. The futuristic area is ironically old fashioned & has boring, dated rides.
Would not recommend"
Epcot offers a nice break... from the other parks,"It was our 1st time back to Epcot in close to 10 years... Not much changed but we are glad that we included Epcot during our latest WDW trip. Animal Kingdom used to be our ""relaxation park"" but with the addition of Pandora there, Epcot has become the park that can be done at a leisurely pace, with fairly minimal planning
What I liked: After staying up quite late the night before (Halloween party) we knew we'd need a day in a park with less lines and rides. Arriving around 10:30am, we were able to use our first FastPasses of the day and cover quite a bit of ground before lunch at Nine Dragons. We strolled a portion of World Showcase after lunch and head back to a few rides after that. We were not able to secure a FastPass for Frozen, but wait time was around 30 minutes, which was quite reasonable. Frozen is actually the only real new ride since we last visited and we really enjoyed it. Test Track is still awesome and fairly immersive. We had a good time at Spaceship Earth and wait times at Soaring toward the later part of the day was on the low end (maybe 20 minutes). The park was busy and slightly more crowded than usual but we felt like we were able to have a really good leisurely time at Epcot. We were there toward the end of Epcot showing Illuminations which was one of the last ""Classic"" night time spectaculars still available.
What to watch for/could be improved: Starting later in the day, having a sit down lunch and maximizing time on rides means that something will usually have to give, especially if you decide to take a spot early for the night time spectacular. In our case, we did not get to enjoy World Showcase as much as we would like. During our visit, the massive ""re-imagining"" of Epcot has started with a lots of walled areas. This is good news, as Epcot is really ""stuck in time"" but for now, this means some inconvenience and detours. The one thing that was not running as smoothly at this park were the character encounters - This is the only place where you'll see Inside Out and Wreck-it-Ralph characters and the lines were very slow moving.
All in, this is a great park to ""reset"" while being able to enjoy very different rides than what other parks have to offer. It has the right amount of ""Disney"" and the right amount of ""everything else""."
"3 good rides, typically bad 'park' food and lots on contruction.","The 3 rides we did were pretty good. The best, by far, was Soaring in The Land. It really was outstanding. Test Track was good, especially for a performance car nut. Very fast and the banking is great. Last was Mission Space. which would be better for kids, but the scenes of the city were really good and I little surprise at the end to get your blood flowing."
"Great time, great food and drinks!","We went on a Monday and Tuesday. Smaller crowds, great experience at many of the countries during Food and Wine festival. It was fun to sample the food and drinks. It can end up being spendy, but probably worth it! Soarin was a good ride."
Elaine,You have to go here. The World Showcase is amazing as well as some of the rides. Take your time lovely photo opportunities a Park to stroll around slowly seeing all the beautiful scenery
Epcot Food and Wine was amazing!,"What a wonderful time we had at Epcot for their Food and Wine festival! There were so many delicious food, wine and beer choices! We went on a Friday in early October. The park wasn't overly crowded, but it was hot. Plan on spending all day there and also plan on spending a lot of money."
Epcot Experience,We enjoyed the various countries and the food at Epcot--lots of varieties and an excellent education for our Earth's environment!
Disgusting treatment of Dolphins,Went on the Nemo ride today and was disgusted to see at the end of the ride Dolphins in a small tank swimming round and round. I can’t get my head around why Disney would have this??!
Food and wine 2019,"Besides the normal activity this time of the year the food and wine adds 40 booths with 100 unique good items and they are an opportunity to visit a country without leaving
New yearly tradition
Only issue is $$$$"
Construction site,"Returning to Epcot after a 12 year absence, this used to be my go to place to chill away from the busy parks, so much to see and so many options.
So much has changed from my last visit, there is construction going on everywhere and people seem to be being herded toward certain parts of the park.
My last visit years ago we had a card that allowed access to the park now we have a so called magic band that you hold against a pad and then place a finger on the scanner.
This would be great if it worked every time however it’s hit and miss, my six year old has about a 90% fail rate and requires a reset each time, which is frustrating and leaves her feeling singled out.
Yesterday both my six year old and I had 100% failure rate after 3 parks visited, after waiting in line at customer services for 40 mins to see what was wrong we were told it was our fingers that were at fault!
So much for magic band should be Tragic Band, also get some hand gel with thousands of people putting their fingers on the scanner it’s a great way to share illness, no telling where some of these dirty sods have had their fingers.
The one big improvement has been the sky liners that get you around the parks, staff have been briefed to push as many people as possible to this new service.
It’s a fantastic way to get about and you can see so much from up there, from the Caribbean resort to Hollywood Studios takes under 10 mins and is so reliable.
The exception to this is the Epcot line which takes about 15 to 20 mins when it does not break down leaving you suspended in the mid day heat with no aircon, when the cabins are moving air is forced in cooling the cabin when it stops in the sun it becomes a oven from which there is no escape,
In the last 7 days the Epcot sky liners have been so unreliable, being left dangling in the midday heat is not an experience me or my children would care to repeat, these breakdowns apparently are not breakdowns but “ unscheduled maintenance”
I was excited to return after all these years, now I kind of wish I had not as it has ruined what was a fond memory."
Walls,"We visited about 5 times during our visit. Just know until the construction is done you will see walls! We visited most of the attractions including our fav figment.
We also watched the new Epcot forever in the wheelchair viewing area. This worked out great for out family allowing our family member to remain in their chair throughout the fireworks. We loved the new show! Great fun with the kites.
We went to food and wine which we hadn't before it was ok went to multiple country's and stands.
Went to see joy and sadness but only saw joy? Not sure why sadness wasn't there."
Amazing Epcot,"I just can’t say enough about Epcot, so clean, beautiful County replica buildings - England, China, Mexico, France, Italy and so many more. We used our fast passes for Soar - the most amazing experience of all the parks we went to. Definitely do your reservations for sit down country restaurants ahead of time as they book up well in advance. We are at La Hacienda and Golden Dragon snd the food was 5 star all the way. The fireworks show in the lake was way better then Magic Kingdom and your could easily view from anywhere along the lake from all the countries. We found viewing by China area less crowded then the other side near France."
Best Part of Walt Disney World,"First of all there are two lands Future World and the World Showcase of Nations .
Future World looks like the year 2100. On the other hand World Showcase has pavilions of eleven different nations. Don’t miss the O’ Canada firm."
A Great Place to go on Vacation!,We've been here 3 times before and see something new on every visit. The Pavilions are one of favourites - lots of food and drink from around the world.
Ok park experience,
A classic,"Sing “parrot’s life for me” with Cap’n Jack, pirates, pigs & more on this Disney water ride! Bit dark."
Pirate Ride,"I thoroughly enjoyed this ride. I like boat roads and thought the story it told was wonderful. I love how Jack Sparrow was incorporated in, and even the surprise little splash at one point. A wonderfully enjoyable ride that made me think of the first movie (the only good one in the entire series.)"
Classic Disney at it’s best,"I could ride Pirates of the Caribbean forever. It is such a nice relaxing ride with a ton of action, it just never gets old. This is a popular ride, a fastpass helps your wait, but even the standby line moves fairly quickly. One interesting fact, at the beginning of the ride when you go down a small drop, you are actually passing underneath the railroad tracks of the train ride and into a large building not within the actual MK park, the majority of the ride occurs in this building."
It's a pirates life for me,The first few visits to the Magic Kingdom my wife and I had not gone on this ride but having watched and enjoyed the films that came about on the back of the ride we decided it was about time we checked it out and we were glad we did. This is a dark ride which does have a drop but as it is so dark you don't see it coming and whilst you do get some water splash at the end of it this is nothing like going on Splash Mountain (my wife hates large drops but enjoys Pirates of the Caribbean). The queue is good but very dark so for some people they may not like it (we did have a young child finding it a bit scary in front of us). If you haven't checked this ride out then it is one I highly recommend.
Favorite Ride,"My favorite ride in Disney World. Seated in a boat while meandering the waters from a pirates viewpoint. Waterfalls, battles and depiction of a pirates life are just some of the experiences,"
Nice ride,One of the must rides when we get to Magic Kingdom. Dark but not scary. Always a fun family time - and it gets you out of the heat!
ARRRRGGH!! ...BOO!,"The Pirates ride has been one of our all time favorites over the years. It has regularly been changed to make it more PC or add characters like Captain Jack Sparrow to the line-up. It's a boat ride, with a queue that moves fairly quickly. The Yo Ho, Yo Ho chorus will stick with you for a while after riding. We were treated this year during the Mickey's Halloween party with an edition that included actual pirates roaming along the queue, making for some seasonal startling moments! The shop that this ride deposits you into is one that we regularly do meander around to look at the Tees and new Pirate gear! Yo Ho Matey!"
Great dark ride,Hadn’t been on this ride here before as I had been on it in Paris and really hated it because of the steep drops. My daughters convinced me that the single drop was nothing like it here and persuaded me to give it a go. I was terrified in the queue and wondered what on earth I was doing but they were right. It’s not at all scary here and the scenery is fantastic. So glad that I decided to give it a go - I even went back again a couple of days later! Queue can be long so get a fast pass if you can. Great shop at the end if you want themed merchandise.
A Classic!,"This ride is one of our favorite rides at Walt Disney World. As you float past various scenes, the story of a Caribbean pirate raid is told - from the initial conquest to the sacking and burning. The effects are good and the music memorable. Plus, it’s covered and cool!"
So much fun!,Great ride for people of all ages. It’s great because the wait is mostly indoors unless it’s a CRAZY queue. The drop in the dark is so much fun and the theming is fantastic.
Fab fun ride,"This is a classic ride on the water telling the tale of Captain Jack Sparrow. Set in the dark, there's even a little drop on what feels like a mini log flume at the start of the ride. A simple but very enchanting ride. And like many other Disney rides, on leaving the ride, you find yourself in the Pirates of the Caribbean gift shop."
Good fun,A fun ride for all ages. Liked the drop in the dark and was impressed by the journey and story throughout the various scenes.
LOVE THIS PLACE,"The first time I went I was 14 and I'll be 59 shortly; I've been to Disney 42 times and every time, Pirates of the Caribbean doesn't disappoint. I've totally enjoyed it and this last time, we were with our grandchildren. They loved it."
Never Miss It,This is a classic Disney attraction! Never miss this one or you may regret it! Typically you don't need a fastpass for this attraction but it is nice to have on busy park days!
Argh,It’s a timeless pirate ride with tweaking over the year. Very dark and some loud noises so some kids might be scared. It’s a boat ride through time. Cute and it ends in the gift shop
Yo ho Yo ho..........,"This one is always a must do. Theming in the queue is really good and passes the time well. Queues times are often OK but fast pass availability is also good. And the water ride itself through various scenes depicting the Pirates films is great. Johnny Depp makes various fun appears and the smell is amazing (check out the Pirates Life candle from Magic Candle Company and you take the smell home with you!)
Great ride - but the shop after the ride need massive upgrade in merchandise which always seems cheap and tacky!"
Fun ride,Our kids loved this ride. The ac was nice. We got to meet some of the characters in pirate gear at the front of it. Don't use a fast pass but worth riding.
Enjoyable first ride of the day,"A nice boat ride taking you through some of the pirates story. Watch out for Jack Sparrow popping up every now and then. Nothing frightening or soaking, however for sensitive peeps it’s worth knowing that the boat does go down a ramp and make a splash. This is all in the dark after the pirate flashes at you.
It’s all underground and water based so nice and cooling."
"Yo-Ho, Yo-Ho, a Pirate's Life for Me!","Over the course of our trip, my mom and I rode this six times - three times during the After Hours event. It's one of our favourites. It's such a classic, and I love how they've tied the movies into it. The final animatronic of Jack Sparrow looks SO REAL. The drop at the beginning is just steep enough to be fun. Make sure to smile at the skull and crossbones at the beginning - that's where the camera is!
And the song is so catchy - it'll be stuck in your head forever. And the smell is so iconic!"
Utterly disappointing,"Just a slow dated unenjoyable boat ride made worst by a complete mix up with the fast pass system , the worst ride I'd been on at magic kingdom"
"Drink up, me hearties, yo ho!",This is a classic ride that has kept up with the times and now includes pirates of the Caribbean and Jack sparrow. The line at times can be long however for the most part at least you are in the shade while you are waiting.
updated,A traditional Disney boat ride that has kept up with modern technology and films. Great show that excites all.
Another iconic Disney Ride,"This was probably my favorite Magic Kingdom ride in 2012. Since then they have changed the show to make it more politically correct and it is just not as good/funny. It is still good and I would gladly ride it again. I'd love to ride the Disneyland version as both are different. It is classic Disney and a must do. I would have loved it if I hadn't seen it before they changed the show and I did still like it a whole lot. For some reason, early in the day it was not operating and Disney offered the option (since we had a Fast Pass) to hold on to the Fast Pass and use it when it was up and operating, or go at any time to several other rides. We held on to it and it was operating later in the afternoon and I'm glad we held on so we could ride this. You definitely need a Fast Pass as there is always a line."
A classic Disney experience with some updates,"One of the classics, even it has received a few updates both in light of the movies and social sensibilities. Rode this one on standby with a group and took about 50 minutes to get through the queue. The first part of the queue isn't terribly interesting, but at least it is well covered. Once you get in deeper, the theming kicks in better and makes for a more interesting wait. The ride itself is pretty tame - it's more of a trip through different scenes. Similar to ""It's a Small World"" but without the incessant song playing over and over. While the animatronics still hold up decently well, it's amazing to think what it took to make them happen all those years ago. Definitely still worth a part of a Magic Kingdom visit."
"Ahoy, Matey!","This is a fun Pirates of the Caribbean themed ride. You may get splashed by water depending on where you sit. Its great for all ages. Upon exiting the ride, you pass through Pirate's Bazaar, a store with cool (and a little pricey) themed tshirts, swords, souvenirs etc. We spotted a Captain Jack Sparrow character just outside of the store, but were unable to get a picture of him or with him."
Fun and silly pirates,This ride is great for all ages as you go through the various scenes of pirates singing etc. You catch Jack Sparrow in many of the scenes. It is a water ride and you may get a wee bit wet if one of the cannonballs splash too close to you. Just a fun ride.
Another classic,They had updated this ride to make it more politically correct. Disney has bowed down to pressure to change the scene of pirates selling women. The boat ride is pretty much the same with a drop that gets you wet if in the front couple of rows.
Boat ride,Travel thru the movie Pirates of the Caribbean on a boat ride. You see the animation of the movie thru the entire ride.
"Yo Ho, Matey!","The newer animated figures like Jack Sparrow are amazing but also in contrast really show how the older ones are out of date. We love the drop and getting splashed, especially as it was super hot outside."
Nothing scary here and you may get a tad wet,"It was a 45min wait but we were on a roll to go on as many rides as possible. It’s beautifully done, attention to detail incredible and a fun filled 5 min slow boat ride through the various scenes. Disney always delivers! You
May get a tad wet on the ride.... Would be more suited for smaller kids, not thrill riders"
Great ride and nicely updated,"Fun ride for the pirate lover and everyone else. The figures look amazingly realistic and the scenes are nicely imagined. The wait can be long, but this one makes it worth it."
Must do at Magic Kingdom,A day at the Magic Kingdom is not complete without a ride on Pirates of the Caribbean. Not the best ride in the park but always enjoyable. The Jack Sparrow animatronics that they added are really good.
Great,This version is much different than that of Disneyland. No drops and no Jack Sparrow. It is close to what the original ride was like.
Family fun.,Always fun and a good way to cool off for a little while on a hot day.My grand daughter sings along with the pirates as we go through the ride.Its an oldie but a goodie and i hope they don't change it anytime soon.
Never fail to do Pirates!,A really great and traditional type Disney attraction. One for all ages and the links to the film franchise certainly makes it more current. Nice boat ride and some great scenes and also Jack Sparrow!
Classic Disney attraction,"This may be a tough sell for teenagers or thrill seekers, but for everyone else this is a classic. The theming of this ride is a perfect example of Disney Magic. You walk through an old pirate fortress on your way to boating the ride. The ride itself is a slow moving boat ride with pirate animatronics, 1 small drop, cool special effects and the classic Disney song."
Fun,"This iconic dark ride is really fun. Seeing the different scenes from pirates of the Caribbean, was cool, and the ride wait times were not too bad either!"
Fun!,Great ride for all ages. All will have fun looking at all the characters. It is worth a fast pass fir family fun!
Watch for Captain Jack throughout the ride,"This is another Disney classic ride that is sadly beginning to show its age a bit. It is still a must-see for first-timers and worth a 30 minute wait or less for those that do not have a FastPass. Lines are usually the shortest right after park opening or just before park close. Everyone sails through this ride on their own boat with several rows of 2-4 people with the best seats being at the front of the ship for the best view, but really any of the seats are fine. Some of the characters are showing their age a bit, but that is quickly forgotten when you spot Captain Jack in the different scenes. We always try to ride this classic at least once during our visit to Magic Kingdom especially if we want a bit of a break from the heat."
Disney Classic,"Pirates of the Caribbean is an attraction that I always make sure to ride. I prefer it over the Pirates of the Caribbean in Disneyland. It has been updated to be more PC, but I kind of miss the original version. The addition of Captain Jack is fine, might make it more appealing to those who enjoy the Pirates of the Caribbean movies. Try not to miss this attraction."
One of the best original ride in the Magic Kingdom!,"We love this ride - it's such a classic. It's usually not that crowded - we often go and it has a 5-10 minute wait. The waterfall is fun and the scenes are amazing for how old they are. It's funny and cool at the same time. The effects are pretty good and the music is the best. You ride on a boat for about 7 minutes through various scenes. (indoors with simulated outdoor vignettes). When the movies with Johnny Depp came out, they added in some new stuff - I think the Depp character (Jack Sparrow ) is in 3 scenes. It's fun and out favorite scenes are the storm, the cannon fight, the fire, the prison and the auction. I consider this one of the must rides in MK when we go."
Gave up.,Was queuing for ride and announcement came. Pity nobody could hear it as they left the load music on after the third announcement we understood it had broken down. Poor communication wrecked the ride for us.
Family Fun,"I remember going on this ride at Disney as a kid and loving it. What little boy doesn't enjoy pirate adventures? Pirate ships, cannon fire, gold, and a little roller coaster fall? It was one of my favorite memories from Disney as a kid.
When we planned our trip this year, I pushed hard to make this our FastPass. My wife resisted. She hates fun, obviously. She already chose Winnie the Pooh and Peter Pan for the day's activities. Are kids are too scared for the Haunted Mansion I wanted to go on, and I think divorce would be on the table if she pushed for its a Small World. But in the end, I won out.
Our Pooh and Pan experiences earlier were not good. Pooh was too fast (no, seriously) and Peter Pan was too high up and dark. So I was not expecting a good experience from this. But I was pleasantly surprised!
The kids and my wife really enjoyed it. The ride was not too fast, and there were plenty of things for the kids to look for all around us. The baby enjoyed riding in a boat, and my older son liked being in the middle of a sea battle. Even my wife and daughter enjoyed it.
Encouraged at being right with my choice, I pushed the family for the next thing I remember fondly from my childhood visit - the Swiss Family Robinson house. That did not go over so well..."
One of the originals,"This is one of the original rides that opened with the park, it has been updated since to coincide with the movies when they came out. Much of it has been unchanged from when I was a child. It is entertaining but relaxing as well as it is a slow moving boat ride."
Still making smiles,"This is the one fast pass I requested when we planned the trip. I love this ride. It was even better with my grandchildren. After we exited we stopped to talk to two cast members, they handed out pirate eye patches and jewels. There was a little extra in the Halloween show."
Classic Disney ride,"Pirates of the Caribbean in Adventureland is a classic Disney attraction. It is a water ride that blends storytelling, robotics and special effects to take guests into a fantastic three dimensional pirate world. You also get a few songs thrown in for good measure. It is great fun and a must do when visiting Magic Kingdom. All my family love this one, to include my teenage boys."
The Worst ride of century,"If I looked up top ten worst things to do in the U.S this would definitely be a top. What even was this. I felt like I was drowning I going so slow. Can we at least go half a mile an hour. The best about this was jack sparrow linger in the background, Also the only drop was an inch down. They spend money making jack sparrow real than the actual ride. The only reason why you should ride this dreadful ride is to look at jack sparrow lingering around the corners. I’m disappointed. It almost got two stars but it deserves a one."
an all time great for a reason,It is a must ride every time I am in Magic Kingdom. It is a classic that everyone can enjoy. All rides change and evolve over time and there is nothing wrong with that although I am sad they changed the redhead auction scene. It was a classic part of the ride. Seems to always have a short line towards the end of the night if you wanted to wait. The line does move quick however so I wouldn't mind waiting.
Serves movie fans well.,A re-visit of first Pirates movie. Details and sound effects are great makes people into that story if people are familiar with it.
Bummer,This whole thing was in reconditioning mode when we were here. Alot of people told us not to miss it... oh well. Some other rides were good for us.
What a disappointment.,I live in Southern California so I usually visit Disneyland. So going on the Pirates of the Caribbean Adventure at Walt Disney World was a real disappointment. Disneyland has two great drops one at the beginning and one at the end. But in Orlando there's only one small drop at the beginning I felt really cheated and that the ride was only half complete.
Always a great time,"You can't go wrong riding the Pirates of the Caribbean attraction. It is a fun, great music and you just get a little wet. They have changed some of the attraction to today's standards, unfortunately, but most of the original charm is still there."
Boat ride through the film,"This was a boat ride through the film, the characters and sets were realistic and there were sounds and smells to further integrate you into the experience. He lighting was low throughout so it may not be suitable for younger children. The ride itself is gentle."
Love the themeing,"I have never actually watched the movie, but this ride has encouraged me to!! The theming and the different special effects from this ride were phenominal. I can see why this ride is so popular."
Adventurous Dark Water Ride,"So this ride is great because it has one small drop in it so it adds some thrill into a classic dark boat ride that has great theming and lighting. The beginning of the ride is pretty creepy though because it’s very dark and has a weird creepy sounding voice in a cave and there’s skeletons everywhere and a hurricane looking scene right before you head in pitch blackness onto the drop. Everything after that is fine but be aware that right after you drop, there is a battle scene with cannons and you can get wet because water shoots out of the water around you and can get you wet easily. Overall really good ride. Wouldn’t wait over 70 mins for it."
Cute ride but the beginning is intense,"This is the ride that inspired the movie by the same name. While most of it is a slow boat ride through scenes of pirates pillaging the beginning was intense and a little scary. It's pretty dark with spooky voice over while passing by skeletons and shipwrecks. Then it gets pitch black and there's a small drop into the main portion of the ride. I may not be remembering well but its seemed like a steeper, longer drop than what I remembered."
one of my faves,i cannot express how much i enjoy riding pirates of the caribbean! its such a classic and it makes me super nostalgic. the feelings i get whenever riding this are so nice you feel like you actually are there! a definite recommend to all.
Great Family Ride!,"When we travel we go with a large group (ages 62 down to 2) and we all love Pirates of the Caribbean. It is a slow dark boat ride and has been refurbished to basically be a ride through the Pirate movies. It is popular, so hit it early or get a Fast Pass."
Back Again to Be a Pirate,"Last review was in June 2017. Every time we come to WDW MK we ride Pirates. While I had read about it, I forget about the change at the auction. I was surprised to see it for myself. Funny and interesting what little lines she does say! Always enjoy this ride. Will return to ride another day. HOWEVER, we went in July and didn't have a Fast Pass for this one. We waited approximately 50 minutes with the line backed up to the entrance. Beware if you get into the queue when the line is this long, it really isn't a straight line queue; it's more of a huge crowd being herded into the single area. Think European queuing methods. Interesting experience. Haven't had to queue like that since I was stationed in Italy. Will return another day."
Always a fun time to visit this ride,"I’ve visited here every time I’ve gone to Disney World, it doesn’t get old. I still find things to look at that I hadn’t seen before. Great for all ages."
Good family ride,"We enjoy this ride. It has a few little thrills and carries the story well. It does offer fast pass. The line is indoors, so cool in the summer months. The theming is great."
Some updates but still a family favorite,Disney has added disney characters into a variety of the attractions. Jack Sparrow and Barbarosa make appearances. This is one time they got it right and the changes flow well with the over all ride. A must see for a trip
This ride has the potential of being a classic,"You travel in a small boat and enjoy the high seas adventure inside a Spanish fortress.
It has good atmospherics and the darkness and smells create an exciting and gentle ride for the kids.
The barge boat takes you through the shadowy Grotto of the Pirate’s in the hurricane lagoon in the open seas to the foggy Caribbean fort, Where Captain Barbossa fighting a war.
The boat goes down a small rushing waterfall and there is your passageway to the Golden Age of Piracy. Plenty of opportunity to get wet.
It is a great ride and is almost a classic that can stand the test of time"
Pirates life for me!,"Visited this attraction with my family of 6 with a fast pass! This ride never disappoints especially with the addition of jack sparrow, you will leave this ride singing a pirates life for me. Great ride for younger kids as well as older! This is a must do attraction at magic kingdom."
A Pirate’s Life for You in this awesome ride at Magic Kingdom!,"A Pirate’s Life for You in this awesome ride at Magic Kingdom!
It’s a spell bounding experience to travel in a small barge and enjoy the high seas adventure inside a Spanish fortress.
The barge travels through the shadowy Grotto of the Pirate’s in the hurricane lagoon in the open seas to the foggy Caribbean fort,Where Captain Barbossa fighting a war.
The barge swoops down a small rushing waterfall and there is your passageway to the Golden Age of Piracy.
Witness the the pirates,in their merry making drunken mood sing a song of jubliation as the flames engulf the sea side town.
Watch the pirates locked up in a jail cell lure the dog to part with the keys of the jail.
Live the life of the pirate and sail along with them in this magic ride which tales you to the 17th Century of the Pirates of Caribbean.
An awesome experience!!!"
What the Redhead is doing now and good fastpass choice.,"We could not wait to get on this and see what the new action for the Redhead would be. Well, I liked her better before and maybe what might have been fun was to show her at the end sitting with Jack Sparrow singing together inferring that she had turned the tables on whomever purchased her. Ok that was my editorial now about the ride.
It has been and always will be such a fun dark ride. The line if you have to is cool and shaded and has some interesting things to see. Good shelter from rain or sun, close to the Parade area so a good place to be after lunch. We like to head here after Splash Mountain. The ride is dark and scary in a fun way. There are some giggles to be had and the ride lets you out into the pirates store where we always take pictures of each other in pirate hats. Aye Aye that was us!"
Slow adventure ride,"This is a seated “ dark ride” on water. You sit in a small pirate boat (2-4 per row, maybe about 6 rows) and you float through the pirate villages.
Over time, the ride has been updated to reflect the newer movies. So, some parts you can tell are new and look great, and other parts, you can tell have been there for 20-30 years. Overall, it’s still a great ride. Great ride for Kids and adults. It’s not fast or jerky, but- NOTE- you may get a little wet as you pass through the 2 ships firing canons at each other. The cue is great. All indoors- good to escape the rain. There is almost always a long wait for this ride. If you don’t have a fast pass, aim to go during fireworks or big parades (last week we went during fireworks and there was only a 20 minute wait) It’s worth it.
Located in Adventure land next to Jungle cruise and across from the Tiki Room."
They changed the ride again!!!,Remember when they changed the pirates chasing the women? Well now the wench auction has gone the way of political correctness. Now the sale is a chicken and random item auction. As a female I'd like to note that neither scene ever offended me. It was simply a part of the pirate time. Not that I condone sexist behaviors or advocate historical depictions of violence. But come on. Disney's pirate ride was always in good taste and entertaining. If they keep sanitizing it there won't be a pirate ride anymore! Still it continues to be one of my favorites no matter what they do.
Ride Ok but.....,This ride is good fun and slow paced but beware of the queues. We queued when it said 45 minutes but got on 1.5hrs later due to the fast pass queue jump system. Its a good ride but not worth 1.5hrs queuing!
Classic ride,"One of the classic rides and one of the last rides Walt Disney had his hands on. The ride has one very small drop and your picture is taken just before the drop. This ride has one of the best songs and you will be singing the tune long after the ride is over. The total ride time is less than 5 minutes and during certain times or seasons, the wait can exceed a hour. Luckily the queue is cool and interesting to walk through. Be sure to check out the two skeletons playing chess in the dungeon. The ride has an excellent gift shop that you will have to wall walk through once you exit."
New Updates to Ride,"So.... over the past many years, the ride has been continually changed to reflect new movies and to adjust for a more contemporary way of thinking. Not only has it been updated with appearances from Captain Jack Sparrow and men are no longer chasing women (the women are now fighting off the men). In the past few months the “bride auction” has also been updated where chickens are now being auctioned, and the famous lady in red has moved from being an auctioned item to a fearless looking female swashbuckler! Still an amazing ride with some much needed updates to the storyline. Well done Disney!"
A classic,"A must-do at the Magic Kingdom, the sights, sounds, and smells will stick with you long after your vacation is over."
Cannonballs!,"While we were in line the wait time went from 30 minutes to 60 minutes because of some sort of issue. Despite that setback, it was interesting to work your way through what looked like catacombs to get aboard the boat. I ended up getting surprisingly wet because a cannonball ""landed"" right next to me, so be prepared to get wet! The theme was fun and it was pretty cool to see Captain Jack pop up throughout the ride."
"Big name, average ride","I don't get the love for this ride, I'm sure it stems from the films, but it's just a small world with different dressing. The only plus points are its something for absolutely everybody to go on.
The queues ranged from 40mins to 2 and a half hours. If it's your first time go for it, just don't queue more than hour, if you've done it before you really don't need to do it again do you?"
Completely disconnected with the spirit of the movies,"The ride starts off promising, you sail through a dark cave, and you can see the remains of pirates who met a violent end. Then, you drop down a hill, and the quality of the ride goes down along with you. It then becomes an overly family-friendly ride, with dozens of pirates singing joyfully as they talk about cliche pirate things. They censored an auction of a woman to make it more family-friendly, but it's pirates. Are they going to pretend the pile of gold Jack Sparrow is stringed by was earned by frugal trading? These are people who murder people to take their money, and they are treated as a pirate-themed Glee Club. They never play the theme of the movies, and it's obvious why. The dramatic music would be completely wrong for the ride. So, to rephrase that, the theme song of the movies the ride is based off of does not fit the ride. I believe the reason for these problems is Disney wanting as many families as possible to ride it. If they had made the ride more adult, it would have been far better. Before riding it, I was imagining the boat you ride in flying through water, narrowly avoiding rocks as the theme plays. I would have loved the ride if they had tried to convey a sense of danger, rather than ""Your safe now, never mind the zombies you saw earlier, and that the town in literally being fired on by multiple cannons."""
not open:(,we traveled far for this and it was not open...what a dissapointment. there were a lot of other things to get our attention
Disabled transfer will be tough,"With a wheelchair they will take you in a back route. Transferring into the chair will require a person to be lifted/carried into the boat, or step down into the boat. And it can be wet, maybe slippery. It is a gentle ride, so this should not be a concern. Transferring out can be a challenge too."
Pirates is great,"Yet another classic, must do ride in Magic Kingdom. A slow moving dark water ride that brings through a pirate battle and old Tortuga. Fun to spot the multiple Johnny Depps.
We waited about 30min for this ride right before fireworks and when we got off, there was no line so we went around again."
A favorite for all ages,"We made sure to ride it one more time before they update it and remove the Red Head scene. Over the years they have made a lot of changes including adding characters from the movies, so it will be interesting to see the changes this time."
Classic expereince,"This ride is presently getting an update, but regardless it is a classic Disney World experience. The scenes complete with water and scent effects are excellent and the plunge into the world of the pirates is always a crowd pleaser!"
Great Disney dark ride,It is still a great classic ride even with the addition of the Jack Sparrow character added at the last renovation.... waiting later towards closing the line is always little to no wait....
Classic Ride that the whole family loved.,"This was our overall favorite ride at MK. We used a Fastpass on it. The Queuing area is fun and pirate themed. The ride itself is a 9 minute dark boat ride through the world of Pirates of the Caribbean. Once you board the boats you sail through a series of scenes. There is one small drop in the dark, it is not very big or scary at all though. Definitely a classic and worth doing. We recommend."
Safe fir the little ones,"My kids were afraid of pirates because of skeletons but they love the ride.
the love the big black drop on the boat.
it appears they are going to remove the lady in red wrench soon.
Capt Jake looks great!"
yo ho ho and a bottle of rum!,"My mom and I went on this ride, and it is such a wonderful experience. You go on boats and are taken back to the age of pirates. I love the different scenes that you see through out the ride like the sacking of a colonial caribbean town, people chasing or being chased by the pirates, and everything pirate you can imagine on the ride. Further, it is cool in there which is nice from having to stand in line or walk in a hot Florida sun."
Boring river ride with a long wait,"I suppose that kids like this ride, but any thrill seekers or adventure lovers will not. Definitely not worth waiting an hour to sit on a boat and watch robots sing at you for less than five minutes."
Iconic Attraction,"One of the iconic attractions, worth the wait but suggest a fast pass. Great fun for the young and old, do not miss."
Arrrrr!,"A fun boat ride featuring Captain Jack Sparrow. Yes, you CAN get wet! A fun drop and songs make this a great attraction for all ages."
Worth the long wait,"Waited 2 hours to go on this ride and it was worth it. The interior of the queuing area is very impressively decorated which makes you feel that you are truly in the Pirate World. The ride itself is a relaxing ride through a pirate landscape featuring caves, ships and a small seaside town. However for thrill seekers there is a small drop and you may get wet."
Family friendly classic,"Love this ride, and we’ll always do it multiple times when we are here. It’s nice and cool inside and has great music and theming."
Great family boat ride,"The attraction is a nice, leisurely boat ride through various pirate scenes using audio animatronics.
It has recently been updated to include Jack Sparrow from the POTC movies.
It lasts about 8 minutes. While a lot of the activities that pirates participate in are not family friendly, this ride is. This is one of my favorite Disney rides. I like the Disneyland version more, but this one is great too."
Good ride,"The ride is a good ride, but pretty uneventfully. Just a straightforward water cruise that is slightly entertaining."
Nice Details,"This is a boat ride though caverns and villages where pirates rule. Note that you may get a little bit wet, especially if you are seated by the side of the boat. There is one short drop near the start of the ride, but the rest is very smooth. As you pass by various scenarios, they are nicely detailed. My one wish would be that the boat could travel a little slower to make it easier to get a good look at everything."
Slow but good fun,It’s a nice steady boat ride with no real jerking or frights but the theming is excellent including the queuing area. Certainly worth doing more than once as you’ll see something different each time.
Good ride,It’s a gentle boat ride through some pirates behaving badly! Pleasant enough but nothing new. A chance to get out of the sun on a hot day. Personally would not “waste” a Fastpass on it.
Good to do if you like Pirates of the Caribbean,"This is a nice, gentle boat ride in most parts. There is one small drop which gets those sitting by the sides a little wet."
Very Cool Scenery,"This is a very nice ride to go on, especially at the end of the day. It’s cool to see the characters and other scenery from the Pirates movies. It’s a relaxing when to end a long day of walking through the park."
Yo ho - Yo ho It's a pirate's life for me!,Classic Disney ride!! Wonderful throwback updated with Johnny Depp as Jack Sparrow. Could do this over and over.
Classic ride with new twist,Pirates of Caribbean has been around for a long time. It has been upgraded when the pirates of Caribbean movies started coming out and is more updated in areas but still retained parts of old ride too definitely a must do when in magic kingdom. Line is usually not bad either!
Great,A Disney ride that is suitable for the whole family. Great graphics and lighting and a reasonably non violent ride. Very Jack Sparrow.
A Fun Ride,"Pirates of the Caribbean at Disney World is very similar to what one finds at Disneyland. A comfortable ride that should be pleasurable for most ages. Highly recommended, particularly with a fast pass."
Superb,A typically Disney family friendly ride. It's nice and cool inside and you'll only get splashed. Plus the addition of Johnny Depp modernises it.
"Fun, dark, water ride","Admittedly, pirates are not my thing, and it was a little offputting to see a comedic portrayal of pirates selling captured women as ""brides"" but it's still a fun/spooky water ride with mostly amusing animatronics. It's not too fast, so, unless the imagery is disturbing, it shouldn't scare little kids.
I found it amusing in a life imitates art imitates life kind of way that the animatronics now include Johnny Depp's Jack Sparrow."
Great Classic at MK!!,We only had the chance to ride Pirates once on our Disney vacation but we often wish we could've gotten at least one more ride in. Every in the family enjoyed it and would consider it a don't miss!
It loses a bit of its charm...,"when there are constant delays, breakdowns, and jams when you are standing in line and a 40 minute wait becomes 75 minutes or more. And, the shine of a pirate's sword dulls, when boats are so backed up, you sit in the same scene for more 10 minutes or more. Suddenly, your favorite ride can become quite boring, monotonous, and annoying. Disney really has to do a better job keeping this one moving. This is a top ride when running smoothly!"
Even better!!,I haven't been on this classic ride in over a decade so now that they added the new stuff it's even better!! Love
Classic Disney attraction,"Classic Disney attraction that is updated for political correctness. Still, it fun.
Do get a fastpass. No need to stand in the lines."
Also one of our favorites,"Always ride this one on trips to WDW. Fast pass works well and at times we have literally walked on depending on day and time of day. Nice place to cool once into the building. Yes, a bit dated but still high on our list. And, nice to be on ride when we have a first time guest along."
Great Ride!!,We had fast passes for this ride which was good as the queue was very long!! The ride was good fun with the boats easy to access and suitable for most ages!
nice ride and good fun,Pirates is one attraction we visit every time we visit WDW. I actually prefer the version in both California and Paris but this is till good. We had a fast pass and avoid the 60 minute wait. The boat is easy to get into and suitable for all ages. Now updated to very much reflect the film franchise which was actually based on this ride. And several times you see Jonny Depp as well. And it is good as well for getting out of the hot Florida heat for a time.
One of our favorites,"Pirates is one of our favorite rides at the Magic Kingdom. A true classic it brings out the kid in everyone. The attraction is usually busy, so a fast pass is helpful."
Fun Flume Ride,I really enjoyed this flume ride and the story it tells along the way. I am not sure if the characters are from an older Disney cartoon or not to be honest. Either way it was a really nice enjoyable ride and one of my favorites in the Magic Kingdom.
Great water ride,"Splash mountain is a fun ride. There is much to look at as you hollowed out log navigates a few drops and scenes at a nice easy pace. Even the last large drop is not really that large, but it does give you a thrill. This is not like some similar water rides where you get soaked, you will only get a little wet."
Fun Ride,"A fun ride that could get you wet. So if getting wet is an issue, stay away but it will be your loss. Lines can be lengthy so consider the FastPass as an option."
Great ride,"Fantastic water ride where you might get wet, you can fast pass this ride as the lines are normally long, right next to big thunder mountain"
Best ride at WDW,Such a great ride. Great music. Great concept. Just wonderfully done. Be ready to get soaked. Loads of fun for people of all ages.
Best log flume ever!,"The queues for this ride are always long but it's so worth the wait. Unless you're lucky enough to have a FastPass, which thankfully we did. There are a few dips and drops but then there's the final lift taking you up a steep climb for the final drop and suddenly you're at the top & the next minute you're flying down the massive drop to the bottom and you're soaking wet. And I loved every single minute. Expect to get soaked & expect to want to get straight back on it!"
A wet trip,This was a fun ride the line was extremely long we waited over 80 minutes the ride takes about 5 to 8 minutes to do but it was a good ride we came off this ride absolutely soaked my 2 kids loved it.
Scary but fun!,"I am such a ride wimp! This was the first time in Disney World for my mom and me, and I wanted to push our comfort levels just a little. Splash Mountain seemed manageable. Sure, there's the 52-foot drop at the end, but the rest was supposed to be pretty chill, just a few small drops. And I couldn't pass up the animatronics and music from Disney's Song of the South.
I'd watched YouTube ride perspective videos. I watched the flumes go down the drop as my FastPass time approached. My mom and I convinced ourselves that we could do it.
Oh, boy. This was definitely at the upper limit of my comfort level! After the first ""small"" drop, I knew I was in trouble. Despite my absolute terror, I still managed to enjoy the songs and the characters. It's a really beautiful ride, and so long! There were two more ""small"" drops after the first, quite close together, so I didn't really have time to ""recover"" in between. When we started going up that final lift to the big drop...ooh, I was scared! But I knew it would be over quickly. I tried to look happy for my on-ride photo - HA! I look absolutely terrified, but it's a funny freaking keepsake to have. Honestly, the drop was worse than any video portrayed it. But it was over so quickly! We got to the bottom to see the parade going by; it was actually the Beauty and the Beast float, my favourite movie. I was laughing at the bottom of the drop, my mom and I both shocked that we actually did it. I came off the ride shaking. I didn't ride it again that week - I think it was still to fresh! But I'll definitely ride it again when I'm back in Disney World."
Fun log flume,Another cute ride with the song of the south and brear rabbit you float along until the big drop at the end. Rain ponchos recommended if you don’t want to get soaked.
Wet!,Splash Mountain is one of the great fun rides and waiting times can be very long - use your Fast pass for this one. You will get wet - but that's the thrill of it all! If you have a digital camera bring along a plastic bag and put your camera away before the ride starts.
A great ride,"Lines are long, definitely a fast pass if you can. It's such a beautiful ride and a nice drop at end. Do the research as to where to sit to avoid most splash. Nice area to wait outside exit if not everyone goes on the ride."
Great Ride!!!,The ride was great. Great way to cool off. The ride was long but it gives you time to see all of the details. We rode this everyday we were at WDW.
Love it,"WDW technology and My Disney Experience app are so good. We had not managed to get on Splash Mountain due to wait times and no fast pass. About 9.45 I got a message from Disney saying ""make the most of your last few minutes in Magic Kingdom today, these rides are only a 5 minute wait"". We headed to Splash, got straight on and so enjoyed the c12 minute ride with amazing music, characters and the exciting water drop itself. And we didn't really get wet either.
Great ride"
Fun water ride.,This is a fun ride. I would use a fast pass for this ride. The wait can be long. I like that this is a warer ride but you won't get soaked.
First fast pass of the day,"When organising our holiday meals and fast passes we though we should make this the first point of call.
When we got in to Magic Kingdom it was quiet so we squeezed a couple of rides in before using the fast pass.
We were looking forward to the cooling splash, but didn’t want to be too soggy so changes shoes while in the queue. Sat at the back we needn’t have worried about the soaking. It was a nice bit of fun, but over quite quickly. Definitely one to do."
First fastpass of the Zippity doo dah day! Totally satisfactual!,"What I wrote last year holds up but I do have some other things to add.
We usually like to go around noon so that if we do get wet we can dry off in the sun, I say the sun because I think it is one of the rides they shut down in bad weather. For those of you who do not want to get super soaked, sit in the last row and on the left, This is hands down one of the best rides at MK or any of the parks. Lots of fun! It is one of the rides at MK that you must try to see it is worth it and honestly I would not go to MK unless everybody in my party was tall enough to go on Splash Mountain.
It is cute and fun has some drops, nothing major, some suspense and plenty of music and animatronics and it has surprises in it.
This year they gave out ziploc bags with Splash Mountain slogans and they were great for phones and passports. Thanks for that, and we kept them for souvenirs."
Very scary !!! I was trembling after the ride.,"I came to magic kingdom assuming that splash mountain will be a non scary ride for little kids but unfortunately it was a scary ride. First I didn’t know how to pull the safety bars because the bars where the same color as the log but a passenger told me how to hold the bars . Then came the fifty foot slope I was nervous and trembling with fear. The ride was very rough and scary. In summer it is a dangerous, scary, and stressful ride. I don’t recommend to go to this ride."
The wettest ride,"Review by Catherine, grade four: Though the line might be long and fast passes quicker, don't buy fast passes for this ride. Waiting in line was amazing we got to see Br'er Bear, Fox, Rabbit and Frog. We also made new friends. You can see the biggest drop from the line and watch the people.
If you ride in the front you will get soaked on the long drop. Bring or buy a towel. There is some splashing even on the small drops. As the ride moves along you see the Br'er Rabbit story which I loved."
Soaked ..,"We sat at the front of this ride and knew we'd get soaked...
The queue is always huge but they get you on the ride efficiently. There's a children's story tale in the lead up to a big drop, which churns your stomach."
Get wet! More than a coaster,I was pleasantly surprised by the calm parts of the ride where we floated by scenes with Brer Rabbit and his friends. There were some issues with the ride so the wait was TERRIBLE but we got through it. Disney does a great job of distraction while you’re waiting! In the end the drop wasn’t so bad and the wet was refreshing!
Sing along,You have a rabbit and a fox on this ride. You sing songs along with the ride and splash down into the water!
Will always be a favorite,"Even on a 50 degree night, it had to be done. This will always be one of my favorites. Also, I believe it's one of the longest rides on property. Don't worry about the getting wet part, you will get wet so don;t let it distract you from the rides enjoyment. Still is and always will be a must do."
Cool Off,This ride is great on a hot day you will get wet and have fun. This is one of the best rides at Magic Kingdom. Be sure to Fast Pass this ride as there is usually a long line. If a friend doesn't want to go on it then they don't know what they're missing.
"My, oh, my, what a wonderful ride!","One of my favorite attractions since I was a child. It usually has a long line (so use a FastPass if you can), but it's also a long ride. Great set design, fun songs, and of course the big drop into the briar patch. Wear a rain poncho if you don't want to get wet."
Do you like to get wet? I don't!,"My kiddos love this ride. And I love all the characters in it, and of course the Zippidee Doo Dah song. But I am NOT a fan of getting wet. You have about a 50/50 chance on this ride. You might get a little wet, a lot wet, or not at all. I always take a poncho! Even with a poncho this time, my seat got wet. Still a fun ride!! This is one of the 3 ""Mountain"" rides in the Magic Kingdom. Definitely fastpass it if you can! If you don't like drops, you can always hang on the bridge and watch people come down and scream! hahaha"
Best Magic Kingdom ride,Splash mountain is our favorite for a number of reasons. The ride itself is great but the theming is second to none. It is also one of the longest rides in WDW and entertains every second of the ride. Do not miss this at Magic Kingdom.
Best ride at WDW,"Splash Mountain is a fun ride for a wide range of people. The songs are great...fun animatronics, good story and the big drop at the end. This is the whole package and a true Magic Kingdom and Disney experience. You will get wet but take it with a grain of salt...we did not put on rain gear and got wet but it was only slightly uncomfortable even at night."
Fun ride that the kids enjoy.,This is one of the best ride's at Disney.You get a good view of the park as you go through the outside part of the ride and its air conditioned so you can cool off for a little bit on those hot Florida afternoons.The kid enjoyed it very much and wanted to ride it again.
A Disney attraction at it's absolute best!!!,"This attraction really shows off everything that Disney excels at. This is full of fun, thrills, excitement, but overall it tells a story! Small kids can easily ride this even though there is a big drop at the end. My 6 year old didn't mind the drop since the whole rest of the ride was so enjoyable and kid friendly.
Make sure that you Fast-pass this for the heat of the day. You will walk right on while every one else is waiting 2 hours in the sun!
This is a must-ride for every Disney trip."
Disney Magic at its best...so don’t fear the drop,"This (along with seven dwarves mine train) is the epitome of a Disney ride experience. The ride slowly draws you into the story with a marvelous mixture of sights and sounds...so much so that you feel like you have in essence become brer guest. The early outdoor section of the ride also offers one of the best views of the park and is especially nice at dusk or night.
The drop looks a little worse than it actually is , so don’t let a fear of heights keep you from missing out ...also know that after you make the drop you have something to look forward to...a true happy feel good Disney moment filled with song and animatronics after you renter the building.
A helpful hint: if you have an I hate to get wet person in your party or it’s going to be chilly when you visit, just drop by a dollar store and get a cheapie poncho for them to wear on the ride and then throw it away when you get off...we did it this time and it worked well for a cool December night."
Best ride in Magic Kingdom!!,"Amazing ride. - we love it! Try to ride with a fast pass or later near closing when lines get a lot shorter. The reason we love this ride is fun, excitement, theming, music and pace.
The ride is super fun. Parts of it are inside, parts outside, some slow and then there are multiple drops and all are a little different. Excitement is in the anticipation of the drops and the drops themselves. The final drop is classic and very fun. Also this ride has a wide range of ages it would appeal to. Our kids liked it around 5 or 6 after they were tall enough, and grandparents can ride too if they are up for it. The nice thing is everyone can see the final drop from outside the ride and decide for themselves.
Theming - world class. Amazing scenery, characters, water features and other details to see throughout the ride. We still see new stuff and we’ve been on dozens of times.
Music - fun and addictive. You will hum the fun music for hours afterwards!
Pace - great pacing. The ride is fairly long and there are slow and fast parts, many drops and different scenes.
A definite must see every time we go to the park."
Best log flume in Orlando,In my opinion this is one of the best themed rides in all of Disney. Really tells a story well and it lasts a long time which is all too uncommon. Great for all ages.
Fun!!,A must ride at disney world. Long and very entertaining. All ages will like this ride. Get a fast pass for this one!
"Love this ride, especially on a hot day!","This log ride takes you through the story of Br'er Rabbit and has several snippets from the story as well as the most popular songs. It is a perfect ride for a hot sunny day because you will feel refreshed from the water when you get off the ride. Because of this, it can get very busy during these times so you may want to use a FastPass or keep an eye on the wait times. The lines can move a little slowly because it is not the fastest loading ride. The majority of the ride is a little deceiving because it is quite gentle as you wind your way through the story, but then there's the final waterfall that is so much fun!! You will get wet on this ride, so be sure that any electronics are safely wrapped before embarking. I would also recommend sandals or a shoe that will dry quicklly for the same reason."
Great ride,Expect to get wet. My family loved this ride. Watch out for the waterfall it gets you wet too. A must do!
Cool water ride,"Did this ride several times love it again try to fast pass it as it's popular.
Love the way the ride leads you on a gentle run. You gradually follow the story of the rabbit thinking your on a gentle boat ride then boom it hits you with a big drop into water mega soaking great fun."
Fun ride!,loved splash mountain! If you are in the magic kingdom its a must! you do get wet so make sure to cover your phone and cameras!
Cool Splash in Disney,I’ve loved this ride since I was a kid. The only problem is the wait. I’d recommend Fastpass or going during a mealtime.
Take a ride with Brer Rabbit,"I'm not much of one for rides that get you wet, but hey it's Florida so can be nice to cool off once in a while. Great attention to detail, fun for the whole family. If you can use a fast pass here ride wait tends to get long."
You will get wet,"Try to organize your party so that the heaviest is in the front seat. That will almost guarantee a big splash. I was soaked from my head to my seat. But, my seven year old grandson LOVED this fun and wild ride. We came off dripping wet and singing the song. Night riding is much more spectacular. When the heaviest is in the back, me. The splash is not so overwhelming. It is also one of the longest WDW rides. You will need a fast pass to avoid longlines during the afternoon."
Oldy but a goody,Always love this ride and the big drop! Somehow I always end up more wet than the hubby but enjoy the cool off.
Best ride in Disney,"Worth the long lines. Definitely the most fun ride in Magic Kingdom if you’re a teenager or adult. A roller coaster on water , with a scary , but short drop into water. A few sprinkles along the way , but a big splash if you are sat in the front row. Good fun ."
"Love this ride, but would love to see it updated.","This has always been one of my favorite rides at Magic Kingdom, but the best things about it are the nice cool boat ride with its fake-you-out drops and the actual big drop. The outdated and racist theme of Song of the South is not really relevant to kids today, and most of them haven't even seen the movie. There are so many newer themes that it could be updated with and I hope that someday it happens."
My wife’s favourite,"Situated at Frontier Land, Splash Mountain is a good length log flume ride with a very long drop at the end featuring characters Brer Rabbit and friends.
Great on a hot day, you don’t really get that wet but it’s the luck of the draw.
Queues are normally 30 minutes plus so worth getting a Fastpass.
A great ride....."
Such a great ride!,Do not be afraid to ride this because you fear you will get too wet. Yes some people come walking off the ride soaking wet but you are in Florida walking around in the sun you will dry off. It is a great ride and a long ride. This is not one of those 2 minutes and you are already off the ride types. This ride is over 10 minutes long. It goes through a great story line and has multiple drops before you get to the big one. It is great seeing the Song of the South characters. Great catchy song that you will be humming all day after riding. Great time to ride is at night there is hardly any wait times.
Night Ride Is Best!,We hit this attraction at night while most were out watching fireworks. The darkness seems to enhance the smaller coasters and makes the fun more enjoyable. This coaster is great for all ages....you will get a little wet!
A firm family favourite,"We have been to Disney a couple of times and this is a brilliant ride, especially on a hot day. It is a log flume ride featuring characters and songs from the classic Disney film Song of the South. There are a couple of drops to include the big one at the end and you are likely to get a little wet, which is not a big issue when faced with the blistering August heat. We got fast passes for this one as it is popular. What is there not to love."
"Great Ride, especially on a hot day","Probably the best log ride in the world due to the Disney's magical theming.
Lines were very manageable on the day we visited, but usually this is a great use of a Fast Pass.
You'll probably get a little wet on the drops, but not soaked so it's perfect for a hot day."
Great log flume ride!,"This is a great.log found ride, with a couple of drops (including the big one!).
Inside there's some nice animatronics and some songs that stick in your head.
Don't forget to pose for the photo on the big drop!"
Rode 4 times in one day,My 4 year old step son loved the ride so much we fast pass and took in line four times. Brer Rabbit and the gang is a great concept. Two dips with the last one being the biggest. Super fun got slightly wet.
better than expected,This ride was great. quite long so it's worth the wait. definitely a must on a visit ti magic kingdom
A Must!,"Splash Mountain is a must. The story line is based on tales from Song of the South. It can be scary for the little ones, but some the same age can't get enough. You will get wet and why they need the waterfall when the boat start to back up on the return to the loading area is beyond me. It nails me every time. Wear a poncho is you don't like being wet. Fast Pass a must."
It’s still one of the best splash ride around,You can’t beat this ride for overall impact. Anticipation in the small dips get you ready for the big splash. Worth the time and waiting.
Great on a hot day,"Great ride on a hot day. If you don't want to get wet I would recommend that you sit at the beach to the left side, I rode it and only got a little damp."
One of the best MK rides,"This ride is in the top 5 of the Magic Kingdom rides. I guess it just depends on what you are in the mood for. Are you okay getting wet?
It always surprises me how long it is. There is a significant amount of ride and storyline before the big drop.
Based on the Disney movie Song of the South.
If it is a hot day and you have a fastpass you can’t pass it up."
Height restrictions,"We planned to go on as a family but only 3 made it as one of my twins were half a cm shorter than the other - be warned!! Anyway, my 4 year old and 7 year old loved it! It tells the story of brear rabbit, who they had never heard of so came out chatting about him! It's a happy, jolly , family ride and great for cooking off- head straight there on park opening to get no queue at all- the rest of the day, it's a massive queue so fast pass!"
Great fun,"Went on this ride for the first time in over 20 years and it's still just as enjoyable. Went on with my husband, daughter and grandchildren. On the day we visited there was a long queue but my daughter had managed to pre-book fast passes.
Once on the ride we had a great time. It's quite long with a couple of tiny drops until you get to the end. What a fun way to finish with the BIG DROP plus lots of screaming. We wimped out and wore ponchos - but lots of people didn't bother. If you sit in the first couple of rows YOU WILL GET WET.
This is a ride not to be missed."
Love it,"One of our favorite rides... its fun, is long, air conditioned and ends with a great drop. You really do not get very wet."
So cute,We are a family of 6 and our children barely made the height requirements. The theming throughout the ride was great. My kids were worried about the big drop but with the lap bar they didn’t even move and this ended up being one of their favorite rides. I would recommend riding this early on before the line gets crazy!
Prepare to get wet,We always do Splash Mountain when visiting WDW. We like to request the front and are usually able to get that by waiting to the side for a couple minutes or less. The front for us us the best and you will get wet.
"Cute ride, fun getting wet!","On a hot day, this is a great ride. You will likely get wet but not too wet. Very cute with the Brer Rabbit theme! Fast Pass works best or we would have faced a 75 minute"
First class,"The theme in this ride is nice and very well made! I just not about the ride itself, have a look around and pay attention to the details, I believe you will enjoy the ride even more."
Worth riding at least once,"Love this ride. However, sometimes we put rain coats on just before boarding as to not get very wet. We enjoy sitting in the front row. It has a great view right before the big drop."
Wet and fun,"Splash Mountain is in my opinion the crown jewel of ride attractions. It combines thrills, water, animatronics, music and story telling into what I think is the best ride at WDW. This attraction gets very busy so try to catch i5 first thing in the morning or fast pass it. You will get wet but not so much as to be drenched. In the Florida sun, you dry off pretty quick. This is one of those rides, you should not miss. Whether your a young child or a 50+ year old dad, this is great fun!"
Disney Imagineering at its Best!,"Splash Mountain is my favorite ride at WDW. The attention to detail and design is amazing on this ride. I enjoy the story the ride tells as you prepare yourself to plunge down the drop into the briar patch. Of course, there is always a chance you will get wet and I have found that I have left this ride either completely dry or completely soaked. Either way, it is still really enjoyable. I'd probably suggest riding this ride in the heat of the afternoon or early evening or as you are leaving the park. During those time periods you will probably be the hottest and the ride will come as a cool down. I always recommend fastpass for this ride, as well."
"Where to sit if you don't want to get wet, best ride of the day!","We always try to get a fast pass for Splash Mountain as the lines for it are crazy long. We usually like to go around noon so that if we do get wet we can dry off in the sun, I say the sun because I think it is one of the rides they shut down in bad weather. For those of you who do not want to get super soaked, sit in the last row and on the left it is a dryer ride than POTC. This is hands down one of the best rides at MK or any of the parks. Lots of fun! It is one of the rides at MK that you must try to see it is worth it and honestly I would not go to MK unless everybody in my party was tall enough to go."
Brilliant Log Flume,Brilliant log flume and for me the best ride in the park. Long ride with lots of short drops followed by the big one at the end. Queues can be big so time it carefully or fast pass it
Great ride to get a little wet(or a lot) and have some fun!,Nice ride where you may get drenched or just a little wet if you're lucky or unlucky! We loved it and we got drenched! Highky recommend it.
A must do at Magic Kingdom !,"One of the top attraction rides in Frontier Land of Magic Kingdom. It’s fun, great for kids and adults, and is a favorite to many. This is a must do ride ... and when I say that, that means it’s a must-have have fastpass+ ride. Take my word, lock those fastpass in while you can, because the line for this attraction is always one of the longest."
One of the longest rides in Disney,"The wait may be long, but this is a very long and fun ride. You will get wet but it is all in fun and this is one of Disney's best."
Must Do,"A favorite of many, Splash Mountain mixes a classic story, catchy tunes, and ride details to produce this popular attraction. Right next door to Big Thunder Mountain, this one will become one of your FastPasses."
Nice...,"We enjoyed Splash Mountain. As the attraction is very crowded we used our Fast Pass + to avoid queues...
Is one of the best attractions in the park so make sure you visit it. The ride is not violent at all!."
"Combination ""thrill-water-cooling-fantasy"" ride.","Oriented toward pleasing kids of all ages, you don't have gigantic ""thrill"" roller coasters and rides at the Magic Kingdom. Splash Mountain does offer one minor thrill: a 50-foot canoe plunge into a pool of water, which naturally is going to spray those inside the canoe and those spectators who position themselves to catch the spray. On a hot and humid day - as is often the case in Orlando, that is quite welcome. If you are willing to make the standby queue, which can be more than an hour, you will be rewarded with a canoe-type ride through the fantasy world of Uncle Remus and his tales of brother rabbit, bear, fox, etc. This ride is one of the best at the Magic Kingdom."
Down Time!,Great ride to take during a hot day as yes you will get wet! The only issue is that it does break down once and a while!
Amazing ride,"I’m a huge coward when it comes to rides but promised my wife I would do everything in Disney as it’s a once in a life time trip for us.
I loved this ride. We used our fast pass which meant we waited less than 5 mins whilst the standby queue was over an hour!
The big drop at the end is fun and the ride is smooth and easy not scary at all and honestly the tea cups are normally abit much for me.
Love the fact you get a picture on this ride too and the use of photo pass is simply awesome."
Big drop at the end,I was tricked onto this ride by my partner who said it was not too scary. The story of Braer rabbit is fun but the drop at the end is a bit high!
Kids loved it,"Got talked into going on this with the kids, it was all good except the drop in the dark, I should have known better. The kids went on it many times and loved it. My tip is to get her eeriest thing in the morning and go on multiple times before it gets busy with long queues."
Not for everyone...,"I have consistently seen long lines for Splash Mountain, and found it’s very difficult to get a FastPass for the ride. Late on a Saturday evening the line was down to 30 minutes so we decided to give it a shot. In short, I won’t be wasting my time on this one again. The ‘get wet’ opportunities might be good for a hot day, but I found the ride boring for the most part, though the scenes were detailed and creative. The big drop is intense but not nearly as death-defying as you’d think for the hype. If the line is short give it a chance, but it certainly isn’t in my top 10 rides at Disney."
Revamped and super wet fun!,This is a favorite of my family for many years and after its recent renovation is given more fun then we remember more drops more water and more opportunities to get truly saturated....our picture was a hot mess but we laughed about it the rest of our evening at the Magic Kingdom
Awesome Flume Ride,"You may get wet, and most likely will get wet. Based on classic Disney movie Song of the South. Large drop at the end at least 40/50 feet."
possibility in getting wet!,Splash mountain is known in getting people some times soaked because it is a ride based in water. You go onto a boat and watch the story bear rabbit. And at the end of the ride you go down a steep plunge into the water where it can potentially get you wet. I remember when my mom and I went on the ride we didn't get wet on account we had two very big people sitting both in front of us and behind us. And they shielded us from the waves caused by us plunging into the water.
Can you get wet? Yes! Will you? maybe!,"I love this ride! I love the Song of the South theme as you ride through it and all of the dips and turns. The last plunge is a lot of fun....just don't like all of the massive, unnecessary screaming!"
Yes you can get wet,We went on it in the cold. You do get a bit wet but not soaked. The ride is a mix of slow ride and then thrill drop but it is a must do if you are up for a bit of a wet adventure. See if you can pose for an awesome picture. must do ride
One of the classics,"Love this ride! You don’t get massively wet, and it’s probably the best themed ride in all of Disney. Quality animatronics, catchy music, and the ride seems to go on forever"
My 2 grandkids love it.,"Last Nov we had the 5 grandkids at Disney and the 3 year old at the time we were unsure if the drop at the end would spoil the fun of the ride. Well when she went down the 60 foot drop she had a smile from ear to ear and said can we go again. So we did.
That's all she talked about was her favorite ride splash mountain. We went again this Deceember and she is 4 and her little brother is almost 3 and again we worried about him getting afraid after the big drop but he loved it too. It's a great kids ride for sure but adults can enjoy it too. Several years ago 8 of us ride it 6 times in a row just to get the right look in the photo...lol"
Best ride at Magic Kingdom,After being talked into it I plucked up the courage to go on Splash Mountain with my folks. Be warned though this is not a ride for anyone who is afraid of heights or the water as there is a BIG drop at the end and you will get WET. Also tells the story of Bret Rabbit so it is fun all ages.
Conflicting ride,"Firstly, this is very fun with a big splash/drop at the end. We loved it.
The confusion for me, is that while waiting for the big drop, the ride is very child-like in its themes and music. This would be wonderful for young children, however they can not ride this due to the heigh restrictions.
So you get an adult/thrill ride ending, but have to sit through scenes/attractions targeted toward young children, of whom none can ride with you to see it.
Weird."
Really fun and really wet!,"This was a great ride that we went on several times during our stay. I never knew the story that it’s set to but that’s quite good too.
It’s good that you get quite wet as well - we needed the water to cool down!"
Expect to get wet,"It’s a log flume ride with several small drops before the really steep one that can be seen from outside. In between, the ride meanders around Brer Rabbit’s farm. Expect to get wet. Good ride. Definitely worth a Fastpass!"
Got very wet!,Splash Mountain in Magic Kingdom is great fun. There are two little drops before the final great splash which got me very wet indeed. Highly enjoyable.
"Very entertaining for little kids, get ready to get wet!","This ride is all about a rabbit and his friends going up the mountain full of water, and you will get wet on pretty much every drop, which there are about 5. And on the last drop, you are doomed if you are in the front, because you are about to get as soaked as you drop down the big hill of water."
"Fun Ride, Tight Fit","This is one of my all-time favorite rides!! However, if you are tall, your knees will be crammed. I’m 6’0 and my knees were crammed. Parts of the ride felt uncomfortable to me because of soreness in my knees. However, it’s definitely not going to deter me from riding this again. I can’t wait to go back to Disney to ride this again."
Fun but cramped,"This ride is a lot of fun. If you have long legs or are really tall it might be a bit uncomfortable, as the logs are a tight fit."
Reopened and fantastic,"Recently reopened after an overhaul, Splash Mountain is back as good as ever. The ride through the land of Brer Rabbit and friends takes you on a winding journey with teaser falls along the way. We always try to catch first timers and convince them this is the big drop, no actually it's this one coming up. By the time they get to the real one, they aren't sure and it's fun to watch their faces.
Of course, you will get wet, so plan on that. Cell phones or wallets in your pockets will likely get damp as well unless you put them in a bag or have someone hold them for you. So remember - this being a fun ride is Satis-Factual!"
Awesome Log Flume,"Let me start by saying that I love this ride and I also love Disney World. This was our fourth visit, we always stay at Disney resorts and use the fastpass system. We are a family with two children.
This has never happened to us before, but after we scanned in the girl working the fastpass line up called us back, so I went back and she said that everything was OK. When we got to the front of line we were rudely pulled aside and publicly accused of jumping the line!! Now, I have no problem with accusing people if you can back it up. Once we talked to the manager it seemed the girl got flustered when we scanned in. However, this could have been handled so much better than it was. I know that Disney has handheld scanners that they could give to the manager of the ride. This was not the case here. Maybe instead of calling a family of 4 out and accusing them of jumping the line, you could say there was a problem when they scanned in and rescan their magic bands to ensure they actually do have fastpasses before announcing that they had jumped the line.
After showing the manager my fastpasses in my phone we were allowed on the ride and given a free fastpass for any ride at the Magic Kingdom. I just think that Disney could do better at handling a situation like this."
Lots of fun!,"Log flume rides have always been among my favorite types of ride and Splash Mountain sure doesn't disappoint!
It could use some updating but the real kicker here is the length and that iconic drop. Over our vacation we managed to get in four rides but our nighttime ride was my favorite (scared my daughter though!!).
Lines can get pretty lengthy so its a good use of a FastPass. Also love the kids play area near the exit - wish there were more little play areas like it around Magic Kingdom!"
The Classic Log Flume,"This has to be the greatest log flume ride ever.
Being from the UK a log Flume can only really be ridden during the summer. Our winters are a bit to cold to ride one of these.
I have always loved Log flumes & Splash Mountain in my eyes is the best there is.
Once inside the mountain the animatronics are great.
The music & theming are first class.
We rode this at 08:05am in the morning during EMH at the front of the ride & got soaked. But it was 80degrees already & we dried out really quick."
A great log ride.,Me and my family really enjoyed this ride. We waited in the que for about 45mins. It is a log ride with a large drop at the end and you did get a little wet. You also get your photo taken on the drop. I would recommend this ride and using fast passes.
Finally got on Splash Mountain! Everything was Satisfactual!,"This was the first year that I was able to bring my kids onto this ride! All our visits over the years we were unable to get a fastpass and the wait for standby was usually 2 hours.This is such a fun ride, it has it all. Thrills and animatronics, music and laughter. This is the first fastpass you should make and then work your trip around it. This is a ride not to be missed, you will get wet. People line up for a good reason, but a Canuck like me can't handle the heat. If you can handle straightforward drops no problems. Number 2 on my list of rides."
Fun,"This is really a great ride, the thieving is first-rate and Magnificent the special effects the music the animatronics are all super. Arizona nervous I've never ridden a particular ride before, but it was great a lot of suspension build up as a bring you up a level then drop you back down and bring you back up, but in the end the drop was super fun Thomas face over in a split-second really not that scary, and I was ready to do it again"
Great Way To Cool Off!,"Another Disney family favourite, perfect for families. Couple of tips, wear sunglasses to avoid getting the dirty water in your eyes, and get a Fast Pass to ride it, the queues are long!"
Do not underestimate,I totally underestimated this ride. After the last drop I was nauseous and dazed for a few minutes....
Really fun ride,"My kids (8 and 10) lives this ride. Of course, their favorite part was the big drop and the end but they also loved the characters and smaller drops throughout the ride. Definitely recommend using a fast pass on this one as the queue is regularly over 90 minutes."
Brer Rabbit Is Up to His Up to His Old Tricks,"This is a combination slow, scenery/thrill ride. The theming of the ride is outstanding. The queue is great...especially when you enter the area for loading and unloading the log boats. You then wind your way around scenes from the movie ""Song of the South."" Brer Rabbit, Brer Fox, Brer Bear and the whole gang depict scenes from the moves throughout. The ride also includes some of our favorite songs from the movie. The thrill comes towards then end when two vultures sit above your log as it begins an ascent towards the top of the ""mountain."" Once at the top, you plunge approximately 52 feet into the briar patch! That is the thrill part of the ride, but hang on there is more to come. The ride continues winding through the scenes of the movies and ends with a grand scene that includes the song, ""Zip-A-Dee-Doo-Dah!"""
Fun big drop...,"This ride was good fun, we enjoyed the drop and excitement.
Only shame is the length of the queue.
I suppose that's Disney for you though. Would recommend a fast pass."
Disney Classic,"This a must experience ride. A log flume ride that has to last at least 10 minutes--it must be one of the longer rides at the Disney parks. Many people are probably unfamiliar with the Song of the South theme, but regardless will enjoy Brer Rabbit and his friends in all of their vintage 80's animatronic glory. Then there are the log flume dips with the big drop at the end of the ride . Wonderfully themed queue line and ride. We saw a lot of little kids on this ride. The last dip may be a little intense for the 4-6 year old, but I guess that depends on the individual child. Wait times for this ride can be long. Reserve a fast pass or get to this ride early or late in the day. We went straight to this ride when the park opened and we rode it twice with no wait."
Log flume,"This wasn't my cuppa tea however the others in my group enjoyed it (I'm just not that big on log flumes).
You follow a story all around the log flume, ending with a steep drop. When watching the ride, it looks like you get really wet however, when on it, although you do get a bit wet, you don't get as soaked as you'd imagine.
Definitely worth booking a fast pass for this one as the queues get very big!"
BEST RIDE AT DISNEY!!!,"Ok I'll tell you straight up...do not pass by this ride! It's a MUST DO FOR EVERYONE! My whole family loves ride! (Even the wimps!) The ride is based of the Song of the South movie and you really don't need to know anything about it to ride. The ride tells the story. The only thing scary about this ride might be the 2 drops in the dark but other then that, everyone should love this ride. Get a fastpass and you're all set. If this is your favorite ride, go very late at night and ride this. You might even get to go 6 times in a row without even having to go back in line!!!!! My friends and I love this ride so we asked the workers If we could go again and they let us go as many times at we wanted to!"
Better with younger kids,"This ride is an old favourite of ours, but with older kids it's no longer the same. The fairy tale theme is a bit played out for us now. We still love the 50ft drop at end being the only reason for still doing it !"
No ride for us.,"We wanted to do this ride before the 9pm show,and entered it at 7.45pm.
The timer read 45 min, plenty of time one would think.
All started well, the queue moved along slowly.
But half way it halted, and over the speakers they told us that the ride had problem.
But they kept letting the express line jump in to loggs, i know they have manage to get a time on the Disney app. But they have not paid more money then me.
So one would think they take every other.
Not just them.
So we had to leave the line, in the end 70 min was not enough to get through this ride.
We realy wanted to see the Ever after show."
Surprisingly Enjoyable,"I was surprised by this ride. I am not typically a fan of the rides that just take you up and drop you. However, I really liked this and did it twice the day I was there. Its not like a power tower where your feet are dangling as you hang there. The whole experience is fun with the ghost story told along the way. You sitting in a chair with a lap belt and the drops are quite smooth. It wasn't something that made me feel like I was going to hurl after. Well done Disney!"
One of the best rides in HS!,This ride is just the perfect amount of scary. Its thrilling and the theming is perfect from the attitudes of the cast members and the design of the line.
Hold On To Your Shorts!,"Ever since my mother used to take the short, but high bridge across the channel to the island my grandmother lived on at a slightly elevated speed - I've prized that sudden lurch in your innards as you have a free fall! The Tower does this, rapidly and multiple times! It is loads of fun, especially watching others experience it. There are few rides that we actually always check those Action photos that most all parks do nowadays for major rides, this is one of them. If it isn't us, there are always someone in our car that is losing it or has the funniest expression on their face. What a hoot! Very unique setting, compared to other similar rides at other parks, of course in the Disney-style. This is one of our favorites at Hollywood Studios and it's right next to the Rockin' Roller Coaster too - two thrills in one spot!"
Fantastic,"Great ride lines where short the day we went, I like to but a coin in my hand palm up when you drop and watch stop in place for a spilt second"
There wasn’t a long wait in a weekend in Sept,I couldn’t believe that the wait times were less than 30mins on the weekend in Sept. Love the ride as it drops to the floor from the top. Fun! Ge there early if you want to ride without queues
Excellent ride with long lines and occasional breakdowns,"For those that didn't search it up elsewhere, this is a elaborately themed, high-end drop tower experience. I won't spoil the specifics, but if you don't like drop towers, don't ride it. If you do like drop towers, this might be the best one I've ever ridden.
The standby queue exceeded two hours most of the time we were at DHS. Fastpass this if you want to ride it. It is a fairly short ride given the length of the line.
The ride broke down twice while we were there. What we were told was that the ride sensors have problems when it's been raining. It's not that the ride physically malfunctions, but the sensors trip and shut it down causing a delay while everything is reset."
Favourite ride at HS,Twilight Zone is the most unique ride there is at Disney. The theming throughout the whole “hotel” is excellent. The ride can get some crazy waits and unfortunately most of the queue is outside so a fastpass is usually the way to do it. I also always recommend waiting for the front for the optimal experience!
Favourite ride at Hollywood Studios,A well themed ride where your elevator is within a twilight zone where people disappear- basically this is a ride where you drop suddenly and ride again only to without warning drop several floors again. Great fun
Drop the Mike!!,"Even during the early Disney hotel entrance, this ride had a 90 minute wait! That however was better than the 3 hour wait a bit later. Reserve a fast pass for this ride. Although repeat riders love this elevator drop, first timers will need to prep themselves for it. You’ll love the detail that has been put into the waiting line also."
Classic ride,"Just a brilliant designed ride . We’ve been on over the years , they tweak it but it’s just amazing. Great visuals and some up and downs and before you know it you’re in the gift shop"
From being scare of getting to eat to Favorite Ride.,"I always been afraid of rides and though I would never be able to ride Tower of Terror.
Every Disney trip, I tried to get into a couple of the rides that I though they were scary and on my 4th trip, Tower of Terror was the ride I wanted to finally tried. And after doing it once, I realize I was missing in what it is the best and most fun ride in Disney World.
Thankfully, I managed to ride it again!"
Come for the drop... stay for the subtle details,"Tower of Terror is my far my most favourite rides at the Disney Orlando parks. It's simple in concept, but as with all Disney rides it's the dressing up with Disney Magic that makes this ride special.
I wont spoil it too much for those that haven't been... but suffice to say you start the ride with a small tour explaining what happened (in the style of a Twilight Zone episode). You then get to experience the drop portion of the ride, with glorious views over the park for a few brief seconds!
Suitable for those in a wheelchair that are able to transfer the few feet to the ride car, the ride I assume will accommodate quite a large passenger with it's lap belt restraint (it fit me at 23 stone, 54"" waist, 60"" chest).
But dont just stare at your phone whist in the queue, there's lots of suptleties to see in the design of the building (one of the most intresting is the sloping of the walkways at one point that is designed to be just plain unsettling)."
Stomach Turner,This has to be the most terrifying ride in any of the parks. People wait for hours to get a chance to scream! The ride is in an elevator in a creepy old mansion where you will experience a 13 story sudden drop! I wouldn't recommend eating a big lunch before this one. Use your Fast Pass or wait forever.
One of the oldest and one of the best,"As usual, our first attraction on latest visit. Superb as ever. Such great fun.
To those who don't like lifts: Don't be fooled into thinking this is like being in a lift. I hate going in a lift and usually walk the stairs instead. But love the thrill and excitement of Tower or Terror!"
Standby lane DOES NOT movr,"90 minute wait in the hot HOT sun. no water fountains or shade. what is disney thinking? standby lane simply does not move, only fast pass lane moves. such a shame that some umbrellas or fans cannot be placed here. what will happen when july/august comes? hope there’s fire rescue nearby as the the standby guests will suffer heat stroke."
Lots of Fun - Great View at the Top,"We really love the Twilight Zone Tower of Terror. It has a fun (? scary) backstory as you are going through the hotel and climbing in the tower. There is a great ""drop"" and an awesome view of Hollywood Studio Park when you reach the top of the tower. Not a roller coaster but a fun ride anyway!
Disney has changed the backstory a little bit to make it more family friendly - but it didn't diminish the fun.
Definitely a Fast Pass choice because the line can be quite long."
Awesome drop,This is a must in the park. Use a fast pass. Lines can be real long. My daughter liked at a 8 year old so you can take somewhat younger kids on this.
Hotel with an interesting reputation,"Needed a room for the night and this is the only hotel within my budget.
Upon checking in I should have realized how come it was so cheap. The hotel lobby was extremely dusty and dated. Staff was moody and unpalatable often given one word answers.
After check in I was directed to the service elevator as the main elevator was out of order. At this point I should’ve known what I was in for.
The saving grace of this establishment is my room had a beautiful view of Sunset Boulevard. Hallways where dark and sometimes difficult to manage.
They also offer a very expedited check out."
Amazing ride- get a fast pass,First time doing this ride and as a family (kids are 8) we loved it!! The attention to detail in the 'hotel' is top notch. You sit in the elevator (lap belt only) and it takes you up and drops you quickly multiple times. Great views out over the theme park during this. Some of the smaller kids were scared when it went pitch black but this lasts only for a second. Wouldn't recommend if you get bad motion sickness but otherwise one of our new top picks.
Terrifying(ly brilliant)!,"I had no idea what this was about until I tried it. I put it on the list because it had 5 star reviews but I didn't read the reviews. So you can imagine my terror when I thought I was actually going to die in that elevator. I didn't realise the elevator was the ride. I thought it was simply transporting us to the ride. The first inkling I had was when the cast member sneered ""You should've taken the stairs!"" as she shut the elevator doors.. But even then, I didn't fully comprehend until I found myself falling weightlessly with my heart in my mouth.
The theming is great. The cast members are all in character. It feels like the place is run by the Adams family. The building is dark and dingy and the ceiling is overrun with cobwebs.
With most heartstopping rides I've been on, it gets less frightening and more fun after doing it again and again so when the kids insisted on a repeat, I cheerfully obliged. Not this one. Doing it a second time was instead a mistake. There was something very ominous about the elevator climb when I ""knew"" it would fall. My screams the second time round were even louder than the first. I didn't go on for a third time.
We used a fast pass both times. (The second one was a complimentary fast pass - long story). Queues were very long because people like being terrified, I guess. We went on around 5pm on April 11th.
The photos are hilarious. There is a very cool video as well so that was a pleasant surprise to see that appear in my memory maker.
Would I recommend it? 100% if you dare!"
Awesome,"Thank God for a Fastpass as line was 2 hours long. Very cool ride. You feel like the elevator is falling but you really don't fall 13 stories, more like a couple, but its still pretty cool."
Love this ride,Such a fun and entertaining ride. The Twilight Zone has always been one of my favorite things and the ride goes so far that my bag literally lifted off the floor and my friend had to kick it down so it didn't go flying. What a lot of fun.
High flying,"One of my kids favorite rides, The nostalgia of the lines and seeing the hotel elevators to the dropping at several speeds and heights. The lines are long but well worth the wait."
The Best,"This is a great attraction at Hollywood Studios in Orlando,Florida. I would suggest getting a Fast Pass since the line can easily be over an hour I've been on this ride dozens of times, and I love the free-fall experience. While you are on the ride, there is a show happening at the same time - so if people are sitting in front of you with their hands in the air, you will miss some of the show. This attraction is similar to Guardians of the Galaxy in the California Adventure in Anaheim, California. This is one of my favorite rides/attractions at Disney. This attraction is right next to Rock-N-Roll roller-coaster, another must-see attraction. There is also a great place to get ice cream near this attraction."
MyStomach in my mouth. Loved it,Could not wait to go on this again. Hardly any waiting lines between 9-10. I lloved the theatrics and props and the scary feel to this place. Ride is awesome.... you ascend AND THEN DROP. A few times. Amazing
Just plain fun,This attraction is awesome it is unique and fun and it is a must do. Did you know that not all the rides are the same?
Great fun!,"From the classic waiting area to the ride itself, this ride hasn't changed in 15 years.....and that's a good thing! The line got long because they had to shut down one of the carts, but there is a cement half-wall throughout the waiting area that you can sit on while you wait. We waited about an hour on a VERY busy Hollywood Studios day but it didn't seem like it was that long."
"awesome ride, but can feel the elevator slow down","supposed to be a fall, but you can feel the elevator slow down, so kinda kills some of the fun. obviously for safety purposes, but still is noticeable, very fun ride though"
More fun than terrifying,"Tower of Terror is always high on our list when in Hollywood Studios. If you don't have a Fast Pass, the wait is long and boring, so try to get a Fast Pass. Once you're in your seat ready for the experience, it's a lot of fun. The groups in your ""elevator"" are usually loud and happy, which makes it all the better. The little Twilight Zone preview is great. Then, the ups and downs of the elevator are really good, lifting you off your seat, and giving you that empty stomach feeling, but in a good and fun way. My only tip would be to concentrate on keeping your head and neck sturdy, rather than flimsy, so that your head doesn't jerk too suddenly forward or backward. Sit back and enjoy the wacky elevator ride!"
I get nervous every time,This is a Fisney must do. I try to ride it every visit. The theming is excellent. I start getting nervous in the boiler room and when that elevator closes - yikes! Even the initial ascent makes me nervous. The ride sequence always changing so you never know when the drops are going to be super intense. I’ve found that the best tactics is to keep your arms up. It’s less scary.
My favorite ride at Disney,"I will go on this ride multiple times - but almost always when it rains or during magic hours. Line is too long otherwise. But I love this ride...If I can only do one thing in MGM, this is it."
How many times can you ride this?,"Our record is 10 in one day (mostly during Fantasmic!). Great ride, well thought out, with an excellent preshow and all details so carefully paid attention to. You will be free falling and you will be rising faster than that, so hand on to your glasses and Mickey Ears, and bags. And your children!"
Always different,This is a great ride that’s different every time you ride it. Sometimes it seems like you go the entire way up and down sometimes not. The premise is fun too!
LOVE IT,"This attraction is so much more than just a drop ride. I was really surprised by all the different elements and stages of it. There's just so much detail and thought gone into everything: The theme, the queue and even the cast members.
You also get some of the best ride photos & videos on this too!"
Loved the ride,"This is one of my favorite rides in the park. This ride is not for the faint of heart if you don't like dropping a couple stories don't go on it.
But if you're a thrill seeker you will love this ride. It's basically a big elevator drop except this is controlled."
Forgot how great this attraction is!!!,"I hadn't ridden this for years and I forgot how great it was. We were able to fast pass it at the end of the day and almost walk right on.
The ride itself is super fun and I had forgotten that the elevator moves horizontally as well, so that made it more enjoyable along with the ghostly images to see.
The kids were 9 and 6 and rode with us. They weren't huge fans of the drop at the end, but liked everything else about it."
Love this ride!!,Great ride that is a must ride at Hollywood studios!! It is great for all ages. We have done it with fast passes and without. We try to ride it a couple times when we are there and it is still fun each time.
Ready to fly?,Tower of Tower will put you in 0 gravity so that you can fly as you drop 5 stories over and over. So much fun!
Still one of the best rides in WDW,"We absolutely love Tower of Terror. On our recent visit we managed to do it three times, twice via fast pass and once as a walk on (no wait) about 7pm. The theming is superb, the ride itself is such good fun. We often find it even more fun on an evening when the guests seem even more enthusiastic in enjoying the ride and creating a great atmosphere."
What a Thrilling Ride!,"This is one of the must-ride attractions at Disney World. The Hollywood Tower Hotel is a ride of emotions and fear the moment you step right into the queue. The twisty pathway invites you into the decrepit and destroyed building from just nature and the past's experiences. The decor is outstanding, and it never gets tiring to see the amount of detail and work put into this outstanding ride. The ride itself is a whole new story: The interface of the ride resets to several randomized patterns to give you a different experience every time you ride it, so you never experience the same twice. It will leave you screaming for more! Definitely a ride that you should snatch a fast pass for, as they run out quick."
Terrifying good fun - our top ride at Disney Studios!,"Love this ride every time! Outstanding theming, great lobby decor, good pre-show, even cool basement waiting area. The ride is undeniable as it’s tall stature looms over the park. Once in the elevator ride car, there is a nice set up sequence involving themes from the TV show The Twilight Zone. The main ride is a quick up and down drop and lift that feels like a falling elevator. There are 4 or 5 drops and the best part is peaking top and getting a little air time. Each ride also is slightly different. A true classic."
Everyone enjoys,"The wait times can be brutal, especially during the holiday season. The ride is thrilling, especially since they have let the computer take over the number of drops and the length of the drops. It is not as predictable as it use to be."
"Never Again, Wish I Could Give 0 Stars","Absolutely awful, from start to end! The check in line was so atrociously long that we waited almost an hour before we got to the counter. I couldn't help but notice that housekeeping was woefully understaffed (or just plain terrible at their jobs) as the whole place was covered in cobwebs and dust.
The bellboys were absolutely obnoxious when trying to catch the lift to our rooms. They were always hovering (for tips I assume) but they couldn't even bother with a simple smile and their attempt at conversation was macabre at best.
And if you thought housekeeping was bad, maintenance was worse. Clearly they were having electrical issues as the lights kept flickering and don't even bother taking the elevators! After that experience I didn't even bother staying the night for fear of what the rooms are like!
Overall disgusting and unsafe hotel!"
Spooky elevator that goes Up and Down!!,"This was our first time doing this ride with our 5 yr old. During our visit on 2 separate days, the ride consistently had issues and was constantly “temporarily closed” so they can fix it. When it reopened, the lines was crazy!!! Even with FAST Pass, we had to wait close to an HOUR. The line was long and if you weren’t lucky enough to get close to the building of the Hollywood Tower Hotel and it’s raining, you’d be standing in line under the rain. That’s what most ppl did.
As you enter the lobby of the Hollywood Tower Hotel, you are welcomed into a creepy/haunted themed lobby. Then into a study/library room where they play a video introducing you to the theme of the ride. This part can be scary for young kids. Then into another waiting area whereby you wait in line to board an elevator.
My 5 year old was nervous about the ride the whole time. I distracted him with other non scary stuffs (ie the beautiful starry lights u can see on the ride before the elevator starts falling down). When the elevator started dropping, we were all screaming but after 2 drops, you get the “feel” of it and we started laughing!!!
It was a LOT of fun!! Even my 5 year old told me he liked the ride. He said he wanted to go on THE SPOOKY ELEVATOR THAT GOES UP AND DOWN again!!"
Thrills!,"I rode this as a kid and was so excited to bring my kids. We had a fast pass, which I'm glad because my daughter started to get scared just waiting for the elevator. The basement part is creepy, well the whole thing is creepy actually (so kids may get scared before even riding). The ride was better than I remembered. Your stomach will drop, a few times. And if you have memory maker you'll get a video of the drop. So worth it."
How to enjoy the Tower of Terror with a bum knee,I'm very glad I didn't let a bum knee keep me from enjoying the Twilight Zone Tower of Terror. Tell the cast member about your knee problem and they should seat you in the middle of the back row. It's possible to sit there and have a leg stay straight out. There are 3 of 4 small steps to mount to get to the back row. Don't let a knee that won't bend well keep you from this fun - and thrilling - ride FastPass helped greatly.
Definite Must Do!,"This ride can scare some children and adults, but my young grandchildren (5, 7, 9) love it. Disney did a great job incorporating the Twilight Zone into this ride. When it gets to the elevator drops you will get a different experience every time. There a multiple drops some long, some short. Unless you are early or late in the park you probably want to Fastpass this ride."
First time on this ride,"Absolutely brilliant easiest way to describe this ride loved it totally brilliant.
Fast pass only though as the queue is massive. Really long lines so fast pass a must.
So glad I finally went on it."
A 'must do' ride,Set in an abandoned hotel. this is an elevator ride from hell. Lots of sudden drops gets your heart beating. Not suitable for the nervous disposition
A top 5 ride in Disney,This is easily in my mind a top 5 ride in all of Disneyworld's parks. Not for the faint at heart but man is it fun. up high and dropping you up and down several times it is a blast. Fun lead in to it as well with the twighlight zone.
Up off your seat,"We have done this ride multiple times. Somehow my memory failed me about how it lifts you up off your seat. The little back pack, wrapped around my foot, rose in front of my face. WOW! Fortunately we had not had much of a breakfast. It is probably a but scary for younger kids."
Great fun,amazing ride-so much fun..thrilling! Our 9 year old daughter might not agree but my husband and I loved this ride.
Funny!!!!!,I absolutely hate ride's that drop so was not looking forward to this ride and very nearly bottled it just as my turn to get on. As you enter you watch a clip about the family that lived in the hotel and that you are entering the twilight zone adding to the tense feeling I was already experiencing. You then are taken on a short ride and then preparation ready to fall. I was holding on for my life expecting to hate every second. A little lad next to me didn't help when he was screaming he didn't want to die. Initially the first drop I had my eyes and hands clenched tight but as I relaxed actually really enjoyed the ride and found quite funny. I ended up going on again next time we visited the park as enjoyed so much.
This will always be my favorite ride at Disney Studios!,"My family LOVES this ride. We'll do it over and over. That being said, it isn't for everyone. It can be terrifying, but it is certainly thrilling! Use good judgement in deciding if your young ones can handle it or not. If they have anxiety issues, probably not a good choice."
AWESOME RIDE BUT...,I love this ride it has great theming and really fun experience but it’s not for kids that just made the height limit unless they are really confident because it’s kinda scary
Family Favorite,"I LOVED it!! My husband and dad loved it.
Our youngest (5) and oldest (67) weren't the biggest fans. But they did it, and agreed it was a terrifying thrill. The Cast for this one are soooooo good too. They really do a wonderful job selling the story right from the start.
Great ride!!"
A firm favorite,"We recently visited Disney in Orlando for the second time and made sure we booked a fast pass in advance for this ride. Whilst it has been around for years, it is one that we look forward to. It is essentially an elevator themed ride that takes you up and then plummets in stages. It is fantastic fun and a must do."
Twilight Zone,"Everything about this attraction is amazing. The theming makes you really think that this is a dilapidated hotel, closed down at its prime during a freak lightening storm.
The staff do a great job at keeping the creepy theme going and the pre-show sets the scene for a ride you won’t forget. By the way, the ride is slightly different every time, which is pretty unsettling in itself.
If you have a magic band, you can get a ride video at the end,
This is the closest you will get to entering the twilight zone for real.
Make sure you DROP IN soon."
Still great!,It's been years since I went on the Tower of Terror. Had a fast pass which was nice. The ride was shorter than I remember but still exciting. We had the drops were it dropped a bunch of little times. The one I was on before did one small drop and them a long one. Both were fun. Love this ride.
Woah!!,"In the past I could never bring myself to ride The Tower of Terror at Hollywood Studios and my wife wouldn't even consider it. Yesterday I finally got nerve to do it and even got my wife on the ride. I have heard so much about how much people like the ride, but not much about the ride itself, so I thought that it just went up and dropped a couple time. I was very surprised when while beginning it had so much of a Twilight Zone feel to it and what it did before it began dropping, but I won't talk about that ( I don't want to ruin the surprise for the first timers like I experienced). My wife and I both enjoyed the ride very much especially once we were down, but would very much ride it again."
"Absolutely, One of the Best Rides at Disney","From the awesome theming to the ride experience itself, this is a simply awesome ride. We visited the week following Labor Day and the lines were minimal - about a 15 minute wait in the middle of the day.
It's certainly a ""can't miss"" attraction at Disney."
Favorite ride on Disney property,Got to hop on the ride a couple more times today. This has always been my favorite thrill ride in Disney. I can’t visit the parks without getting on this at least once. Fast pass is the way to go for this one. Also a great time is at night when fantasmic is going on. You can usually get on a couple times during that show time. The drops are always random so you never get the same ride twice. The entire theming of this ride is great and I love the interaction with the staff.
Where you leave your stomach behind in the tower!,"A very scary ride and very well done, especially the build up, its not what you expect. Went on this ride as a family with teenage children. All of us thought it was scary, me (mum) more than any of us, helplessly screaming as it plummeted several times, leaving my stomach behind. Not sure if I should have gone on this, i did it, but never will again.
If you want to experience this ride and take your life into your own hands, make sure it’s first on your list as you enter the park. The queues are long as it’s very popular.
Use your FAST PASS on this one."
"My teen loved it,",My teen was afraid to try this ride. When we got on the ride stalled in pitch black darkness for a few minutes. We didn’t mind because it added to the terror. They did offer everyone to stay on and ride again.
Amazing Ride,"We had speedy passes though if I had to queue for 45mins it would be worth it, best not to eat prior..."
What a thrill,"This is such a Disney classic and just so cleaver how the ride leaves the elevator shaft and travels around the hotel until it drops you like a stone and it seems like an absolute age where you and the seat part company
We did this ride in France and now in Orlando and it’s up there with one of our favourites"
A Disney Favourite,"From start to finish this is an Disney classic. The theming, the attention to detail the role of the cast members, the build up and the actual ride. You enter the hotel ad show through the lobby to a short video based on the Twilight Zone. Then it's into the service area and a short journey to the Twilight Zone and a series of freefall drops in an elevator shaft which are totally random. At some points the doors open and you can see over the park - if your eyes are still open !!! Worth repeated visits and a Fast Pass. One of our favourite Disney rides."
What a rush! People are screaming and laughing!,"If you have a hard time with ""up-down"" rides you still might be able to do this one. You're so caught up in the atmosphere, the creepy stuff, the excitement, and it's a random ride each time since the computers have so many options, that it's more scary than tummy upsetting. I can do this ride, love this ride, but can't do one in an amusement park. The whole leadup to the actual first drop is so intense. And when the doors open up you can see the new Toy Story Land and the building of the new Star Wars area so that's fun to have those quick peaks. Waiting in line is entertaining but fastpass it if you can since it's so popular. And if you do feel icky after the ride there are bathrooms after you exit the gift store on your way out."
Scariest ride at Disney world,"This ride is so crazy cool with all the theming from the twilight zone tv series but it’s really scary for people scared of the drops in the dark, creepy atmosphere and loud creepy music. As you can see by the name, “tower of TERROR”, it basically implies that the ride is going to be scary. This is a very thrilling dark dropping ride and fits with a great story that will have you shaking after the ride. Quick note for all the twilight zone fans, at the very end of the ride, as your elevator moves backwards, you can notice a whole bunch of Twilight zone references including the dummy from “The Dummy” and “Caesar and Me” which I thought was very scary and very cool at the same time."
Terrific.......,"An absolute Classic, a Series of freefall drops in an elevator shaft! Located in Disney's Hollywood Studios just around the corner from the Rock n Roller Coaster. Kids must be at least 102cm. Worth a FastPass. Worth going on more than once so check queue times on MyDisney app for short waiting times every now and again whilst visiting Hollywood Studios, If its showing less than 20 minutes, hop on."
Great fun!,"I remember walking past this ride a few times visiting as a kid but passed over it because it looked too scary. My wife convinced me to try it on a recent visit and it was awesome! The drops we experienced were only a few floors at a time, which added to the fun. Plus there was another rider on board who was laughing hysterically during the ride, which made it even more enjoyable! Definitely work checking out!"
The best experience in the Studios!,"Aside from the hype and promotion of Toy Story Land (which by the way, has little shade for some reason), the best attraction is Tower of Terror.
Luckily, this one wasn't transformed into a Guardians of the Galaxy spectacle like in California. The detailed, authentic look and feel of this experience is one of a kind, and is a classic. You'll also want some cool souvenirs from the shop after you fall in love with the ToT!"
Aaarrrggghhhh,"This ride never fails to leave your stomach high above Orlando. Get a fast pass if you can as the lines are long pretty quickly. We did both we went on this and the rock n roller coaster on entering the park when there were small standby lines and we also used a fast pass. So to do 2 big rides twice in peak season is a result. The anticipation builds as soon as you enter the attraction. The staff are brilliantly glum in keeping with the atmosphere. I won’t say too much in case there are first time visitors reading this review, just hang on to your hat! Love this ride!"
"Thrills, Chills and Spills!","This ride is insanely fun. The drops are computer-programmed and randomized, so you never know how many times you'll drop or how high you'll go or how far you'll drop. It's such a blast. From the pre-show to the ride build up to the nervous anticipation of the drop. It was fantastic."
Neat ride. Ok for 6 and up,"This ride is neat. Right amount of scares fir smaller kids 6 and up. It’s well designed and essentially is an elevator ride that goes wrong with short drops and climbs.
Set in an old Hollywood hotel and using the Ywilight theme it create a good atmosphere and setting for the ride."
Please give my sons “magic band” to a cast member,"To the people who picked up my sons magic band yesterday 30th June. Please give it to a cast member. You have your own blue ones! Don’t wreck my sons holiday by taking his souvenir. How do I know you have it? Well your pictures on tower of terror and slinky dog come to my photopass as the Bluetooth is still working. Disney is watching you like magic.
Please return it today. You are wrecking a 10 yo trip.
Not cool.
PS didn’t go on tower of terror- you did."
My kid cried,"Great ride! Really good thrill ride for the whole family but do be warned that if, like us, you have a child that meets the requirements but can be easily scared, dont take them on. My 7 year old was in tears- honestly, I was shocked at her reaction ! I loved it, as did my 3 year old little boy...so it doesn't scare all kids !!"
Awesome- one of the best rides in WDW,"I'm a huge ToT fan. The great thing about it of course is it doesn't just drop, it actually pulls you down, so you'll be very glad to be wearing a seatbelt! Also it drops at random, so you never know quite when it's going to do it- well worth riding multiple times. Queue times very quickly rose to over an hour (June) so FastPass is needed. Ambience is great- the look of the building, the music, the interior decoration- all fantastic.
The only thing I'd say is, when you're at the top of the tower, you get a view of- the carpark. Kind of breaks the illusion a little bit. Come on Imagineers, no one wants to be reminded of the outside world! Having ridden ToT at Tokyo DisneySea, I'd say that one's a little better. But still, this is a great, great ride.
Some may find it too scary but that's for individuals to decide- my 4 year old loved it."
My FAVORITE,"I LOVE this ride. The scenery and story are top notch. The ride is a blast with repeated rises and drops. My children were terrified at 6 and 10 and refuse to ride to this day at 18 and 21, but I have seen many kids really enjoy it. I sat by a 10 year old who was nervous at first, but got off laughing and said it wasn't too scary. I look forward to this ride every time I come back. You do need a Fast Pass!"
my favourite,this is by far my personal favourite ride of all time . the staff put every effort into making sure that you have a thrilling ride so they stay in character all the time. another one you may want to use a fast pass for .. i went on a few times so had to queue it isnt so bad even when its up to an 80min wait its really worth it suffice to say if you want to feel the thrill of falling in an elevator go on it you really wont be disappointed . if you have photo pass+ make sure you scan your card or magic band at the end of the ride as you will get a video of you been on it and it will really make you scream and laugh for sure :)
Different experience,The drop was making butterflies in dummy!!! For this we went during magic hours so no much waiting. You may get fast pass for this.
Great fun,We actually took our 4 year old on. She just made the height and she loved it so funny and a bit scary !!!
Amazing ride!,I love thrill rides! This is one of the best in Disney and it scared the sh** of of my girlfriend. This is my first to go activity.
Our favourite ride at Disney World,"We have been on this ride loads of times during our three visits in 2009, 2011 and 2017 (myself, husband & two children; now 13 & 16), and we all love it, we all think it's the best ride in all the parks at Disney World, not just Hollywood Studios.
The bit while you're sat in your seat moving to the lift area ready to be dropped is really good, and the ride itself is fantastic - scary, but fantastic.
This is the one ride Disney must not change or get rid off."
One of the Best Disney Rides,This was a special time on the Tower of Terror as my two oldest granddaughters (8 & 7) joined me on the ride. It does a great job capturing the spirit of The Twilight Zone. The anticipation is much scarier than the ride itself. Take the time of observe and take in the details built into the this attraction. Love this ride.
Vertical drops were cool !,"The ride featured some moving through the hotel with mirages, ghosts, etc. But the best part is the drops up and down, they were really fun."
One of my favorite rides,"You don't have to be a fan of the Twilight Zone to love the Tower of Terror, but if your a fan, this ride is amazing. Definitely one of the best themed rides in Hollywood Studious. It has amazing effects incorporated into the ride and a great backstory. The whole walk from the gates entrance to the elevator is just awesome, ill never grow tired of it, I highly recommend taking a slow walk through at night. The rides not bad, it's a drop or several drops (as each ride cycle is assigned random drop numbers, so each ride experience is unique). They do take your picture before the first drop, when your at the top floor and the doors open to reveal the park. If you have the my Disney Experience app on your phone, you not only get the great picture, but a nice video that has your drop footage and some extra added backstory footage.
As you drive towards Hollywood Studious you will already begin to notice the Hollywood Tower Hotel. A towering building that is just calling your name, your interested at first, as you get closer, you begin to notice that somethings wrong with the hotel.
Once you can finally get a better view of the hotel, you notice the massive damage to front of the building, it looks like the building may have been damaged by a fire. When you enter the park the tower will loom over everything, calling your name. When you finally decide to investigate and walk towards it, you are shocked by just how massive it really is. You begin to notice the grounds around the building, they are in bad shape, no one has been taking care of the grounds or the building, but yet its beautiful in some strange way. As you near the tower, you hear screams coming from the top of the building and as you look up you notice that the elevator is shaft is exposed to the outside.
As you walk towards the rides entrance, you are greeted by one of the hotels staff members, they welcome you into the hotels grounds and you walk past its massive gates. As you walk through the grounds towards the lobby, you hear some 1920's music playing, you would think it would calm you, but it just makes you more nervous.
As you leave the grounds and enter the outside of the hotel, you notice that the hotel is in disrepair, it has to be abandoned, but if it's abandoned, who's playing the music and who was screaming earlier? You walk under a terrace thats covered by dead bougainvilleas. An empty fountain rests in the middle, not one drop of water is left inside, just some dead leafs. You notice a lone bench out in the open, while it appears as if no one has sat on that bench for ages, you sense that is not the case.
As you finally make it to the lobby, you are shocked by it's current state. Everything has been left in place, from luggage to an unfinished mahjong game. The lobby is covered in cobwebs and dimly lit, creepy but elegant at the same time. As you make your way through the lobby you are directed towards the library, and you adventure begins here."
Great ride with the best Disney effects,Take the time to enjoy the wonderful Disney theming in each room as you make your way into the elevators. The lines can get very long so a fast pass is a good option for this ride.
"Floor, Please","The multiple drops were unexpected and added to the thrill of the ride. The setup before the actual ride was the Twilight Zone and set the stage for what was coming. Even though you are strapped in, when the ride fell, you still felt like you were going to doomsville. Really a lot of fun. Do use the FastPass because the lines were long and we got to zip right pass everyone waiting."
Interesting ride,It's a drop ride with multiple drops (5 I could remember). The hotel setup is nice. This is the most crowded ride in Hollywood Studios.
"A bit more than just a drop ride, probably eat after it rather than before","I'm a big fan of the cheesy trashy Twilight Zone style of horror and this didn't disappoint, I was expecting a simple drop ride but it offered a little bit more than that.
Again fast passed this and got on in about 20 minutes, it had consistently long standard queues throughout the day never dropping below an hour. Definitely worth an hour queue, anything longer and its down to how much time/how long you are staying at disney as to whether it's worth it.
Good pre ride entertainment but it is probably not for smaller children or anyone who's of a wussy nature, due to the ride itself and its scary content."
Must Try Ride!,"We had a ""fast pass"" for this ride, as the waits can be lengthy and we had a blast!! Each time this ride is slightly different, so you're never prepared for the drop! Loved the pictures and short video we received from our experience."
What a terrible hotel,From start to finish this was a terrible hotel stay. The staff were rude and might I add a little creepy. We had to queue for quite a few minutes of check in and then came the lift ride. Oh my goodness that was horrific we got to our floor but it turned out that the floor didn't exist and at that point the lift carriage just dropped. I nearly spilled my cup of tea. I will never stay here again.
"Scary on the outside, Disney on the inside","My teenagers freaked out over the idea of being dropped, and the creep decor on the outside. My advice, suck it up, respectively lol, and go for it! Once you get inside the decor is pleasant 1940s, reminding most of a simpler time, with nods to the American classic, Twilight Zone.
The ride itself only uses a lap belt. Every ride changes its pattern of drops and falls, but it’s done in a Disney way that makes you cheer instead of scream in horror.
Don’t skip it! Enjoy!"
The theme helps set the stage for a great ride,"It's more than just the drop, the whole ride is entertaining. The way the cast members act, and the entire theme makes this ride special. By the time you get to the actual drop you are quite disoriented and it takes you by surprise. Our disabled son was able to ride, we lifted him into a seat and he did fine, the cast members were very accommodating of our needs."
Great! ...when it works,"The ride itself is a ton of fun. But only when it’s working properly. There are a total of four elevators that comprise the ride. Half of the elevators were not working one day during our recent visit but Disney honored 100% of the fast passes. Seems logical to me that only 50% of the fast passes should be honored or given out if only 50% of the ride is working. If you were in the standby line you were screwed. The wait time said 70 minutes which is too long to begin with but we were prepared for. It turned in to double that. Disney, try harder!"
Welcome to the Twilight Zone,"The ride is great. The queue is awesome. Rod Serling is incredible. But seriously, this ride works for some and not for others. We've got family who can ride Rock n Roller all day long but not this and visa versa. I love it and love how there are multiple variations. It's fun."
Kids love it!,"Things to know, get your fast pass early,
we showed 15 minutes before our fast pass time and the worker was nice enough to let pass in.
there is a couple of rows once in the ride. people like to stand in the up and down motion of the ride. its loads of fun for first timers. great theming
40"" and up"
The best ride at Hollywood Studios!!!,"This ride is by far the best at HS by a country mile!!!! It’s a drop ride with a great story line basically with views over the park!!! Plus it videos you too if you have photo pass which is a great touch.
It’s on the first right as you walk into the park and you cannot miss it!!! Watch out for photographers who will take your photo on the palm tree lined Avenue leading up to it.
This is tamed down compared to the California and Paris Disney equivalents but still awesome - I know this after checking with a cast member because my wife daren’t go on after the California ToT!!!!
This is one of the busiest rides so reserve fast passes!"
Weightlessness,Every time I ride this ride I love it more. Took my youngest son with me and we both loved this ride. Highly recommended
Our family's favorite by far!,"You can have Rockin' Rollercoaster all you want, we'll take Tower of Terror please. Never a disappointment unless you get some rowdy punks that are talking and screaming the whole time. Every time you go on the ride, the sequence of ups and downs is different. It's completely random and you never know what to expect. Fastpass for sure or either Extra Magic hours or first ride of the day if you don't want to wait in lines. I've seen it up into the 3 hours and it does sometimes go down for periods of time but still well worth it. Fantastic ride. The theme-ing is also great so if you're in the standby line make sure to look around inside."
My New Love,"The Twilight Zone along is high on my list of favorites! I had never heard of the show(It is before my time) so I thought that it was just a nother ride at the park, so i went on and absolotly loved it. So one of the good this about this ride is that you don't need to k ow the show to under stand what is happening they give a bit of an explanation.
The ride it's self is mostly dropping there is however some coasting aorwnd on a track before you start to give back story and highten tension.
When I visited the park it was during spring so the parks where very packed! But because the ride fits so many people if you go at the right time you will not have to wait in line for too long. Although, if you can get a fast pass it is always better.
And if you are looking for a good picture on a ride as a keep sake this ride is the best for that! Especially the first time you ride it because you will not expect the sudden and long drops that the ride will give you.
The strange and spooky vibe the ride gives you is similar to the haunted house ride. I personally now love the TV show and don't know why I didn't know about it sooner, all because of that experience on The Twilight Zone.
And look out for the ever so spooky changing entrance sign at the ride
""You're traveling through another dimension. A dimension not only of sight and sound, but of mind. A journey into a wonderous land whose boundaries are the of imagination. Next stop the Twilight Zone!"""
Worth the wait - THRILLING,"This ride was AWESOME! So thrilling as it drops you down and throws you back up. Loved it. The wait was very long. Over an hour and a half but it is worth it.
It also takes your picture so get that magic band ready."
by far a must go to!,"This attraction is such a wonderful terrifying experience. It is based off the old tv series called the Twilight Zone. And it has a very spooky ride about passengers who happened to cross over into the Twilight Zone, and you as the new visitors to this eerie hotel are to learn about this mystery. And you do it all by boarding an old elevator and it takes you through a labyrinth which will then lead you to see some cool things. As well, it goes up and down dropping you. Now i will counsel that if you have light weight kids, hold onto them. I remember when the ride went up and down really fast, i felt that i was floating off my chair from the g force and my mom had to put her arm on me keeping me on the ride.i also would recommend kids under eight shouldn't be on this ride."
One of Disney's Best,"This ride is awesome. The theming in the preshow to the ride itself all made it enjoyable and thrilling. The only downfall is the storyline and use of cinematography when you are on the ride, is very dated, however it does not ruin the experience."
Amid the glitz and the glitter...,"Honestly, I've been on tonnes of attractions and this is now my absolute favourite. The theming is perfect, the special affects are mind-bending, the plot twists are awesome and the thrills are actually FUN! I've seen loads of reviews saying that little kids would hate this ride but honestly I think they would love it, and any young kid I saw go into the 5th dimension came out wanting to go back ."
Visit Another Dimension at the Tower of Terror,"Love this dark, drop ride at Hollywood Studios. It was the first ride at Walt Disney World to offer on-ride cameras so that you can buy a video of the ride. (Seven Dwarfs Mine Train has the same technology.) Grab a fast pass if you dare to enter the Fifth Dimension and bypass the standby line."
Must-Do Ride,"I love this ride so much that I went on it twice on my last visit to Disney World. From the very start, you are immersed in the atmosphere. The vibe is so creepy and cool. The ride itself is amazing. The drops are absolutely thrilling! This is a must-do for thrill seekers at Disney’s Hollywood Studios."
One of our most do rides,"We've probably ridden this ride 75 or more times, but it never gets old. Especially since they went to random programing. The ride is always different and is always fun. It's also out of the sun on hot days. Fast pass is a must during busy times as the wait can be over an hour."
Best ride at Hollywood Studios,"The ride is themed as an old hotel from The Twilight Zone. You start as a large group and watch an opening scene a la Twilight Zone on a small TV then you exit that room and wind through a basement scenes area for a utility elevator. The highlight is when your elevator drops and then bounces up and down. It is very dark inside. At times the elevator, whose elevator shaft is at the edge of the building, comes to a window and you can see out across the park.
Exhilarating ride.
We were here after Christmas.
There was a long wait, but it is worth it."
