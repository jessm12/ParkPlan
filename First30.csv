"Disneyland that lost it's magic, totally","We have visited multiple Disney parks in our life and we decided to give Disneyland Paris a go despite the numerous not so good reviews and we decided to splurge on staying at the Disneyland Hotel itself. The location and decor was the only great thing in the hotel, but the price of the hotel is much doubtful when we are downright discriminated by some of the staff which pulls down the overall experience. We have never felt disappointed and unhappy and eagerly excited to leave Disneyland as a whole in our whole life being really avid fans of Disney and traveling around for all the different parks. Majority of the staff were polite but they did not carry the theme and hype of Disney.
After traveling to many parks, Disneyland Paris took away the magic and totally diminished any magic left in us.
Particularly several staff that you may have to interact with a lot such as the hotel receptionists handling the checking in and out. None of the staff were helpful with baggage, none of the staff were initiative. Particularly, Arianna, please beware that you have to be in her books or you shall be downright discriminated and treated as a fool for being a hotel guest in their most expensive hotel.",Negative
Smokers everywhere. Minimal non-sugar food offerings. Toddler would still enjoy.,"If you've never been to ANY Disney park, the kids will still enjoy ok.
Smoking is permitted almost everywhere outdoors, and was overwhelming.
A piece of chicken + fries was 17€.Can´t buy fries alone. I'd actually recommend getting kids' menu (chickenburger/fries/drink/ice cream) for everyone (8.99€).
Access from centre of Paris easy - use the stop in Auber, as this ensures you have a seat.
Simply doesn't compare with any park in the USA or Asia.",Negative
We had a great time but....,"We had a great time but....
This places is an overcrowded, outdated rip-off simply cashing in on being Disney.
This is our second visit, both being at Christmas. This time we stayed at the Disneyland hotel (I’ll review separately) but needless to say that ain’t great either.
Last time we stayed at sequoia lodge but when we priced up staying there again, character lunches and wild bills it was pretty much the same price as staying at the Disneyland hotel where it was all packaged together.
The magic hours are a god send. We really made the most of these and used them to get on everything we wanted numerous times (we had 3 days of these). The average queues outside of the magic hours for any of these rides was at least an hour. (Peter pan, hyperspace mountain, buzz light year, mine train etc). Being prepared for this we instead booked in all the character meals, took in the parades and shows, generally made the most of the Disney experience.
It’s not all bad. The parades and shows are really really good. As are the character lunches and the general being Disney stuff.
The problem with this place is it’s pretty small. There’s probably as many attractions in Alton towers. The place needs updating, Disney Florida are constantly expanding and updating but when did Paris last get a new ride/park that wasn’t a rehash of a previous one. It simply isn’t big enough in terms of attractions to take the number of visitors.
It’s also a massive rip off, food and drink prices are beyond a joke. You even need a small mortgage for a coke or a bag of crisps.
Then there’s the smoking and queue jumping. Smoking is everywhere, even in the queues. Staff do not challenge it even when it’s right in front of them. I even smelt cannabis at one point.
I knew before I went this was the last time we would go. We went for the Disney Christmas experience. We loved it and the kids loved it.
Is it value for money: absolutely not. Do they care: clearly not!",Negative
Beautiful but..,"I had been to Disneyland Paris in October 2018, and wanted to compare my visit to December 2019. One thing that stuck out to me was half the restaurants and carts were closed on both visits! I’ve never seen Disney not have everything open to suck every last penny from our wallets, but Disneyland Paris apparently does not care. The decorations were beautiful and the rides are awesome like always. It’s a must stop for any Disney lover.",Negative
Great fun but overpriced,"Disneyland is great fun for all ages it really is. We were very disappointed to discover that if you have the half board dining plan, you had to book to eat at a buffet restaurant. We were not informed of this beforehand and it spoilt our day somewhat to be told by a rude french lady that we could not have a table as we hadn't booked. We then had to queue for 40 minutes for a counter service burger. The only way you can book restaurants before you go is to call the restaurant- this is no good if you are in the UK as of course you would be calling a french number.
Best to get fastpass on some of the rides (Thunder Mountain & Buzz Lightyear) but we didn't queue for any ride longer then 25 minutes.
The parades are lovely to watch and the fireworks are really good. Good idea to stay in a Disney Hotel close to the park because the shuttle buses get very busy when the fireworks are over.",Neutral
Dated and run down with rude staff,"The staff at Disneyland Paris are rude and not helpful. Not a smile on anyone’s face. It is definitely a bucket list with no return.
1. Most of the rides are shorter than California. For example, the RC Races does two swings only. It’s a Small World runs only a for six minutes while California runs for over 10 minutes.
2. Buzz light year guns don’t work. They go off and on.
3. Staff are always chatting to each other and they don’t smile to the general public. This is literally throughout Disneyland Paris.
4. While I was trying to purchase an expensive glass rose from one of their shops, two staff members kept talking to each other. One of them was actually trying to complete my transaction. They seemed to be annoyed that I had a few questions to ask.
5. Audrey from Hypersapce was standing at the front entrance. She seemed to be upset about something. I asked her if the single rider is open. She scolded me and questioned why I ask. Not a smile on her face. Very rude. However, I dare you to find more than five staff members through the park who know how to smile or are genuinely wanting to help.
6. Disney charters are hidden behind closed doors with none to see. Waiting time 90 minutes plus at least.
7. The food is not too bad.
Would I have cancelled this trip if I go back in time, maybe not because I needed to experience it myself with my family.
Am I going to come back, definitely not. Especially with the rude staff, short and dated rides.
Did I enjoy the rides. Yes I did but nowhere to compare to Disneyland California.",Negative
Magical at all ages,"Second time around and I really loved it. My daughter and I had a great time. She did rides she wasn’t confident to do last time. It was her highlight of our Paris trip.
I really enjoyed how you make us feel when we are there. La magie continue",Positive
Save your hard earned money and go to alton towers,"Just to add to the many bad reviews (these are true!) the 5-4 star one's must be by Disney staff or the brainwashed!!
Discusting corporate greed of the highest order, you expect to pay more but come on 10 euro for a balloon!!? After spending 4 days here I was actually looking forward to getting to the airport and paying their prices!!
Staff hit and miss generally unfriendly and quite unhelpful but again we expected this, been English they can't abide us and it shows in the attitude of some of them.
Go somewhere else don't give this company one penny of your hard earned cash!!",Negative
Money for old rope,"Disneyland was supposed to be the highlight of our European Trip for our 3 children. Instead it was overpriced, overcrowded and the rides were starting to feel old and dated. 14/12 was a supermaxi price day which means it's the highest price bracket. The park was packed, queues were long, it was difficult to find anything/anywhere to eat, the merchandise was excessively over priced. The whole experience felt like a Disney cash grab!",Negative
Guards behaviour,"This is absolutely magic and beautiful place without any doubts!
There are big lines to some attractions but this is something you are aware of before you go. If I may recommend anything is that if you have 2days and budget for it stay there for two days and just enjoy the moment and don’t rush.
Now...
I’m not the one who is complaining without a real reason.
Unfortunately there was a huge disappointment and I think Disneyland manager should better take care of the crew they are hiring for security that is very important but the person that are working at the gates and their behaviour is totally unacceptable. They are so rude! I had to stay 15min only in my T-shirt in -2celcious as one of the guard was checking every single button in my jacket. The whole procedure to get there for our family took very long so you can imagine staying at the gates with kids because someone is shouting at you in French and telling you to undress.
Same rude people are working at the lockers on the main station. There were shouting at us in french and didn’t took in the end our bags in the end so we had to walk with everything.",Neutral
Wonderfull,First time in Paris with my children. We went to Disneyland Paris to discover this park. My children were amazed.The Christmas decorations were beautiful and the performances were fabulous. Magical moment!! We leave with lots of photos.,Positive
Relaxing Holiday,Disneyland is always wonderful. It was a cold winter day with rain but the youthful spirit of Mickey Mouse prevails. The parade was still awesome.,Positive
Its absolutely Magical,"Went here in April with our 2 kids aged 7 and 14 and we at first didnt like it as queues are so long but there is so much to do and some Rides are shorter to go on. We done so much in the few days we visited and i'd highly recommend it to people with or without the Kids.
Planning to Return in 2020 or shortly after as we've other trips planned ahead of this.",Positive
An Improving Park,"The park has really improved over the last five years. I have been once a year since 2015 and there are more characters and entertainment than ever before. However I do still find there should be more random characters as every day there are the exact same characters bar one or 2 surprise ones. Fir the number of guests every day there really should be a character everywhere you look.
Apart from this I do love this park and the rides especially those renovated over the past couple of years are just incredible. There are so many little details everywhere you look.
The parades and fireworks are just spectacular and I cry every time without fail!",Positive
Family visit over Christmas,"We visited Disneyland Paris wirh our toddler over Christmas 2018 and we all loved it.
It was very busy (as expected) but the atmosphere was great. The Christmas decorations were beautiful and the performances were fabulous.
The fireworks were spectacular.
We only visited for 3 days, and didn't manage to see everything. I suppose if you went during quieter times it would've been possible.
The rides for younger children are great and they have loads of them.
Food is quite expensive for what it is (mainly fast food). They do have other places to eat but it was out of our budget.
We are planning a visit again soon and we can't wait to get there :)",Positive
"Enjoyed Our Time, But Remember It’s Not Orlando!","Came here in November and the first thing that struck me was how busy it was, considering it was school term time. We enjoyed it and managed to get everything done in a day. We loved Space Mountain. Having done Florida a few times I would definitely say this is on a smaller scale, price for price I think I would rather go to the states. The firework show was really good with various songs/movies being projected onto the castle. Prices for food and drink inside the park are of course are expensive but there is no restriction on bringing your own, also small back packs were allowed on the rides including Space Mountain. Tip buy your tickets online and not at the gate you will save a fortune!!! One park One day admission was €107!!!",Neutral
"Recommend multiple days, busy even in off-season","We were not expecting the crowds at Disneyland Paris in October that we found. The lines do not move fast and many rides do not accommodate many riders, so plan accordingly. Our plan was to do both parks in one day, not a reality and we missed many attractions due to this one day plan. They also repair many rides during the off season. This all said, we loved the park. The atmosphere is different from the American theme parks, the buildings are french and a multi-cultural experience. The cast members are helpful. Skip Chef Remy - big disappointment in food quality and service - plus the time and slow service. Better to grab the same or better food from quick service. Make sure you explore the castle, this is one Disney park that has attractions and adventures in the castle. Enjoy - this place will put a smile on your face.",Positive
One of the happiest places to visit - Disney Land,"Disneyland is truly the happiest place on earth for me. I can’t imagine not going to Disney just because I’m not a child anymore or dont have kids to take. Even better for me without kids.
I have always been a Disney person, from watching the animated films, reading books, it's just a form of escapism for me. I have visited Disney World Orlando several times, with my son and on my own. I have made so many amazing memories at the parks and it brings me back to my childhood. I can never tire of it and guess I would be pushing a Zimmer frame in old age going around the parks. Disneyland Paris though not as big as the ones in America is still very good and as exciting. Good for all the family. One of my happy places on earth.",Positive
Charming Visit at Christmas,"The decorations, parades,flowers and lights were perfectly made for Christmas season.
We took the RER from CDG-Etoille to DLP.
We had our tickets printed at home and had no problems scanning it at the gates or at the fast pass machines.
We arrived by 9:30, they let us in a little earlier. We started with Hollywood studio park. Crush's coaster, fast-pass for Ratatouille , where we met the characters and had fun . Then we left to go to Park 2 . We played Hyper-Space mountain, Star Tours and Buzz light year. Then we headed to Frontier-land to play the Big Thunder Mountain and to get on the big sailing ship. Afterwards, we played the Pirates of the Caribbean and finally at Fantasyland we played it's a small world.
The Christmas Parade was unmissable ! The songs, colors and everything was perfect. Afterwards we loved the All Characters parade followed by the greatest lighting of the Christmas tree and finally the big famous Disney Illumination Show.
The weather was a bit cold , the rain was very very light that you can't feel it and it didn't last long as well.
The Wifi connection was good. The application was very helpful.
I had visited Disneyland before in May 2018. It was not as perfect as it was in Christmas season.",Positive
Magical place at Christmas.,We have been here on many occasions before but this was the first time at Christmas Time. Main Street was beautifully decorated with massive Christmas tree and decorations and a snow machine which blew out snow from above at various times to make a fab effect. As ever the park has great rides for all ages and during the day there is two Christmas themed parades. A truly Great place to visit at Christmas.,Positive
5 Stars only for Cedric,"Went to Disneyland last week for my 18th...thoroughly enjoyed all the rides. However, my experience was completed by two of the actors on the Hollywood Tower of Terror. I’d like to give a shout out to Cedric and Marine for their acting that exceeded exceptions and left me wanting more. I think both deserve a pay rise...my experience would not have been the same without them!",Positive
Terrible,"If you want a Disney experience do not go to Disneyland paris, save up and go to Florida. Both parks are dated, they feel old and look old. The cast members are rude, lazy and pretend they dont speak English. The Disney village is tired and boring not worth the time. This Christmas stuff was ok but not mind blowing.",Negative
Was a real letdown,"Went to Disneyland this week and felt really disappointed there was not rides for teenagers rock n roller had been taken down, space mountain was shut, have a 15,13,8 all mixed age groups I found there was nothing for teens.
I visited Disneyland a few years ago were the characters walked around the park this was so much more fun then booking appointments to see them.
I found the whole park had not changed since we first went at that was 2006 Definitely needs more and new rides and go back to letting the characters walk around the park again it was so much more magical.",Negative
"It’s Disneyland, what’s not to love?","I’ve been here many times over the years growing up and brought my girlfriend as a surprise this year for her first time and my first time in 10+ years.
We both loved it, there’s entertainment across the two parks for everyone if all ages. It’s just such a great time and there’s no experience like walking through the main gates and hearing the music and being immersed in the Disney magic!
It is expensive, all the merch and food is expensive, but which theme park isn’t?
It also gets busy, so have an idea of what you want to do the day you’re there and use the apps wisely!",Neutral
Fun Day,"The best family park in Europe where tou can spend your fun time with all members of families and friends.
Amazing attraction, games and shows",Positive
Magical but expensive,"First this is Disneyland - so who couldn't enjoy the atmosphere and even more so heading towards Christmas time. The Christmas parade was beautiful and the lighting of of the Christmas tree spectacular. We spent 2 days in fantasy land.
We stayed at the explorers hotel - rooms were basic but comfortable. Lots for kids to do when you're not in the parks. The free shuttle service was excellent - find out where you're to pick the shuttle up - the pick up and drop off were in one place but we had to go to a different 'bus stop' from where we were dropped off. Worth checking so you're not rushing at the end of the day- with tired feet and tired kids!
But the queues!
Not many street vendors so you are pushed to go into restaurants- the queues are ridiculous- waiting an hour for lunch!
We waited an hour to see 1 princess and that was a good waiting time - when came out it was up to 2 hours. But for us an hour that was worth it.
Money money money but be funny...
For anyone who has been to Paris before - it's expensive but Disneyland takes that to another level. €80 for a kids Elsa dress up outfit (£33 back in Disney store in the UK!) - and yes we did get stung - we promised our little one she could buy an outfit - we couldn't go back on it! All the costumes were similar price!
On the second day - now feeling skint! We found a McDonald's for lunch - you have to come out the park (but easy to get back in) it's behind planet Hollywood - near rainforest cafe - similar price to back home. Ok so not the fine dining experience that you may expect in paris but quicker and cheaper than the ones inside the park.
And ask - if you've not been before speak to other families in the hotel or on the shuttle - best way to get top tips. After all you don't want your stresses to ruin the day.
Did we have a good time- of course we did and would defo come back but just be prepared to spend more than you planned.",Neutral
Amazinggg!!!,"I love Disneyland Paris. It was my third time visiting but my first time visiting when there were the Christmas decorations and it was magical. A bit annoying is all the queues to certain rides and some people putting their phones up when there is a parade. However, that has nothing to do with the park as such. It's amazing and I dare say that it is a must visit at least once in your life.",Positive
Just as good as Florida,"A lot of people said to me that this place wouldn't be as good because I had been to America and to be honest, I was pleasantly surprised with how good it was. Of course it isn't as big as Florida and maybe there arent as many rides for the big kids but children would definitely enjoy it just as much and my partner and I enjoyed it, the big kids that we are.
I would recommend coming off season and during the weekday as we managed to get around everything in one day.
Coming without a bag makes life much easier.
Also, we have a system, you start at the back of the park, then work your way forward, we found that everyone runs onto the rides right at the front making the lines huge but the ones at the back we literally walked through to the end. Do that!
Seeing Disney characters you have to book in advance. Luckily we got a space to see Jack which was a nice surprise from the boyfriend.
Overall, I had a really good time here. I would tell people to not think down on it because it's not an american Disney. Just as good",Positive
Definitely go for Christmas,"The theming at this time of year is amazing - from the beautiful decorations to the fabulous themed snacks. Its just a magical time to visit and really gets you in the festive spirit. The Christmas parade and tree lighting ceremony are amazing - and the snow down main street is fab.
I wish there was a few more Christmas themed meet and greets but jack skellington and santa stitch were super cute!",Positive
Magical,"We have just returned, we had the most amazing time and have made memories that will last forever! All of the rides, parades and shows are perfect. All the staff were so friendly and helpful!",Positive
